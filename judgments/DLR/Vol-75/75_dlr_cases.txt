Judgment
Naima Haider, J:

1. This application filed by Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust/BLAST in the nature of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to ensure the fundamental rights of equality between women and men. The petitioners felt aggrieved by the continued inclusion of a provision in the prescribed marriage registration forms (kabinnamah) (BG Form Nos. 1600 and 1601), which perpetuates discrimination between women and men, and also by the failure to require photographs of the parties to be submitted when registering marriages. Under Muslim law as applicable in Bangladesh, marriages are required to be registered in the prescribed form (the Kabinnamah) pursuant to section 3 and 5 of The Muslim Marriages and Divorce (Registration) Act, 1974 ["The 1974 Act"] read with Rule 28(1)(a) of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Rules, 1974 ["The 1974 Rules"]. The rules have been further amended in 2009.

2. The distressing matter of fact is that after conclusion of the registration procedure of marriage by the parties, Form No. 1600 is kept with the Kazi's office and Form No. 1601 is provided to the parties. Both forms at clause No. 5 require the bride to make a statement as to her marital status and her sexual history, specifically stating whether she is unmarried or virgin/ widowed/divorced. In contrast, the forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/divorced /previously married or is a virgin.

3. Such a clause targeting the women in particular and which is so discriminating and arbitrary that it has created inequality between bride and groom as only the bride is required to provide her personal information regarding marital status, sexual history etc. which is being robustly violative of fundamental rights, in particular the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sex, the right to be treated in accordance with law, as guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution. Interference with such privacy also violates a women's right to personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 31 and 32 of the constitution.

4. Inclusion of the Word "Kumari" instead of "Unmarried" is humiliating and degrading the women's personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 32of the constitution and contradicts with Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) inasmuch as it has the effect of discrimination against women on the basis of sex, also impairing the dignity of woman by invading upon their privacy. This Court issued Rule in the following terms:

"Why the entry No. 5 in Forms No. 1600 and 1601 should not be declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect being discriminatory against women on the ground of sex and marital status in violation of Articles 28, 31 and 32 of the Constitution, and as to why the respondents should not be directed to take necessary action:

(i) to amend the Bangladesh Forms No. 1600 and 1601 (kabinnama), by omitting the use of the word "Kumari" in respect of brides, and,
(ii) to ensure that information regarding marital status (never married/ married but divorced/marriage subsisting/) is required in respect of both men and women without any discrimination, and
(iii) to impose a mandatory requirement for both the bride and groom to affix their respective photos to these forms, and
iv) to produce National ID Card at the time of registration of marriage."
5. Mr ZI Khan Panna, the learned senior advocate appearing for the Petitioner with learned advocate Ms. Aynunnahar Siddiqua submits that the writ petition has been filed bona fide in the public interest to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to ensure the fundamental rights of equality between women and men, the impugned inclusion of a provision in the prescribed marriage registration forms (kabin-namah) (BG Form Nos. 1600 and 1601), which perpetuates discrimination between women and men, and also by the failure to require photographs of the parties to be submitted when registering marriages. He further submits that after conclusion of the registration procedure of marriage by the parties, Form No. 1600 is kept with the Kazi's office and Form No. 1601 is provided to the parties, both forms at clause No. 5 require the bride to make a statement as to her marital status and her sexual history, specifically stating whether she is unmarried or virgin/ widowed/divorced, in contrast, the forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/divorced/ previously married or is a virgin.

6. Learned advocate for the Petitioner vehemently submits that the impugned requirement is so discriminating and arbitrary that it has created inequality between bride and groom as only the bride is required to provide her personal information regarding marital status, sexual history etc. which is being robustly violative of fundamental rights, in particular the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sex, the right to be treated in accordance with law, as guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution and interference with such privacy also violates a women's right to personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 31 and 32 of the constitution.

7. Mr Amit Talukder, the learned Deputy Attorney-General entered appearance by filing affidavit-in opposition on behalf of the respondent No. 1.

8. The case of the respondent No. 1 is that the Rule 10 of the Muslim Family Law Rules, 1961 as framed under the Muslim Family Ordinance, 1961 provided a prescribed form No. II wherein at serial No.5 the words virgin/ maiden/widow or divorced were inserted. Thereafter, under Rule (1) (Ka) of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Rules, 2009 has formed under the Muslim Marriage and Divorce (Registration) Act, 1974 provided a prescribed form as Form-Gha wherein at Serial No.5, the similar words were inserted as virgin/ maiden/widow or divorced lawfully.

9. Mr Amit Talukder, the learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 1 submits that prescribed Forms for registering marriage (kabin-Nama) has been inserted under the provision of Rules 27(1)(Ka) in the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Rules, 2009 which has no intention to hurt the privacy of women.

10. Mr Ishrat Hasan, the learned Advocate entered appearance by filing affidavit in opposition on behalf of the respondent No. 5.

11. The case of the respondent No. 5 is that the right to freedom of religion is an important right of the citizens of every modern state and article 41(1)(a) of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh protects the citizen's fundamental right freely to profess, practice, and propagate religion. The protection given to this right is not absolute. It is subject to law, public order and morality as article 41(1) itself denotes. The freedom enunciated in this article 41 is a personal freedom. It is a freedom which a person can claim for his personal exercise at will. The freedom guaranteed in this article is the right of any person to entertain such religious views as appeal to his individual conscience without interference by any person or power, civil or ecclesiastical, is as fundamental in a free state as is the right life and liberty. Religion, in this article, includes all form of belief in the existence of superior beings exercising power over human beings by violation, and imposing rules of conduct, with regards in the present life as well as with future rewards and punishments in life hereinafter. The religion under the constitution need not be theistic. Citizens irrespective of their religious beliefs are entitled to the right envisaged in this article. All shall enjoy equal constitutional guarantee. Among religions our constitution adopted Islam as the state religion of the Republic at the same time ensuring equal status and equal right in the practice of the Hindu, Buddhist, Christain and other religions. Whereas, religion of a person is his own belief, contention of inequity cannot be applied here.

12. Mr ishrat Hasan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No.5 submits that the petitioner alleges this term "Kumari" is humiliating, unreasonable and degrading and at the same time violative of fundamental rights protected by articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution. The respondent No.5 disagrees with this contention. In Bangladesh sexual intercourse between an adult man and adult women is not offence. So, if any women had sexual intercourse before marriage and give birth to a child remaining unmarried later marriages someone hiding existence of her child and then the consequences would be adverse. The man to whom she is married will put her to a grave dispute regarding the parentage of child and she may face the litigation of fraud. Another consequence is that if she is one month or two months pregnant at the time of marriage and after her marriage according to section 112 of the Evidence Act, 1872 the husband will be the father of the child. Then question DNA test will arise and ultimately litigation.

13. In the midst of the bearing, this Court felt it necessary to invite one/more advocates to assist this Court on the issues of Islamic family laws and jurisprudence, one of the learned advocates of the Bar, namely, Mr M Belayet Hossain voluntarily came forward and expressed his intention to act as an intervener in this matter. Accordingly, we have allowed him to assist this Court.

14. The intervener learned advocate Mr M Belayet Hossain submits that the issues involved in this Rule touch the Constitutional regime of equality, privacy and freedom of religion. He submits that this Court should, in disposing of the Rule, examine the essentials of a valid Muslim marriage, legal and shareeah characteristics of an Islamic wedlock. He has categorically submitted that the essentials of a muslim marriage are that there should be a proposal, made by or on behalf of the parties to the marriage, and acceptance of the proposal by or on behalf of the other, in the presence of two witnesses who must be sane adult Muslims, at one meeting, although traditional Islamic family law does not require a marriage to be registered, the 1961 Ordinance, 1974 Act, 1975 Rules and 2009 Rules require a muslim marriage to be compulsorily registerable, failure to register a marriage has been made an offence, the solemnization of marriage if validly effected might not be affected for non-registration of the marriage, but the non registration of the marriage causes a doubt on the solemnization of the marriage itself, although marriage may be presumed from prolonged and continued cohabitation as was held in ALM Abdullah vs Rokeya Khatoon reported in 21 DLR 213. He further draws our attention to the decision reported in 8 ADC (2011) 855 (Momtaz Begum vs Anowar Hossain) wherein the Appellate Division observed that marriage among Muslims is not a sacrament but purely a civil contract, marriage brings about a relationship based on and arising from a permanent contract for intercourse and procreation of children between a man and a woman. A marriage contract, as a civil institution, rests on the same footing as other contracts. Though generally solemnized with recitation form the Qur'an, no specific ceremonies or religious rites are necessary for contracting a valid marriage, nor is evidence in writing required. Thus, deletion of the impugned word or re-phrasing the same in a more sensible way will not in any way affect the personal laws of the Muslim citizens inasmuch no religious script made the impugned disclosure in public a requirement for validity of a marriage, rather the principles of Islamic jurisprudence do not sanction publicity of one's sexual history or disclosure of such a private issue in a public document, he submits.

15. Mr M. Belayet Hossain argues that the submission made on behalf of the added respondent to the extent that 'the word—kumari-should be there to determine the issue of consent in a marriage as a girl who has not experienced sexual cohabitation in the past must not be married to a man without her consent' is misconceived inasmuch the conduct of a girl of a tender age in wedlock is observed by her wakil/guardian and the witnesses to the ceremony who are required to put their signatures in the impugned kabinnama on being satisfied that the essential ingredients of the marriage have been satisfied, and the other clauses of the impugned kabinnama e.g. clauses 7, 8, 11, 19 are sufficient to deal with the issue of consent of the girl, the kazis appointed for the purpose of registration of Muslim marriages are required to follow the legal and shariah principles in respect of the conditions and warranties to be satisfied in a wedlock and generally they explain the same before the parities/their agents or wakils/guardians. Thus making a provision for mandatory disclosure of a fact vis-a-vis sexual experience/in experience of a girl is a superfluous act. Moreover, since the impugned term takes different meanings at different places should be deleted from such a public document that carries solemnity, sanctity and religious fabrics. He submits —'obviously The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 [Act No. XXVI of 1973] made provision for the application of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) to Muslims in Bangladesh, and by the Laws Continuance Enforcement Order, 1971 all laws that were in force in Pakistan, continued to be in force in Bangladesh (this provision was substituted by Article 149 of the 1972 Constitution), therefore, Bangladesh inherited all personal laws along with the citizens' personal laws, but no personal law sanctions mandatory disclosure of a sexual history in a written document or in a marriage session/ceremony, rather Islam discourages disclosure of a very private issue to members of the public', therefore, the deletion of the term—kumari—from the impugned kabinnama will not affect any provision of the personal laws of Muslims.

16. He finally submits, additionally, that in a society where hundreds of child marriages (with or without taking consent from girls) are taking place despite there being strict application of the restraining laws, where forced sexual intercourse/ rape etc. takes place at urban and rural areas, forcing a girl to disclose her sexual history in that circumstance in a duly solemnized marriage ceremony (on repudiation of the previous marriage in cases of forced/child marriage or in a wedlock of a rape victim) is out and out a degrading treatment towards her and that attracts the Constitutional provisions of right to privacy, right to be treated equally and in accordance with law, moreover, public policy or social morality prohibits such an arrangement in a formal written declaration.

17. We have considered the submissions advanced by the learned advocates, perused the petition, affidavits-in-opposition, application for addition of party, provisions of the relevant laws, judgments and the extracts taken from the books written by the scholars in the relevant fields.

18. This Court is of the view that since the issue of Muslim marriage is primarily guided by the personal laws of the Muslim citizens of the Republic and since the 1937 Act recognized the personal laws (Shariat) of Muslims as laws of the land and since the framers of the 1972 Constitution did guarantee the right to practice and propagate religions in the Republic, it should not examine the constitutional legitimacy of the impugned entry made into the Kabinnama without considering the legal and jurisprudential aspects of Islamic/muslim marriage (in Arabic Nikah) in the instant context. Thus, we will be examining the constitutional, legal and Islamic jurisprudential aspects of the issues in question, additionally, we will take international obligation vis-à-vis the non-discriminatory treatment towards women into consideration in disposing of the Rule.

Issues for determination by this Court

19. In the above premises, we will deal with the following:

a) Whether the impugned entry is violative of the equality right of the women of the Republic or whether such an insertion has affected the non-discriminatory character of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh ;

b) Whether deletion/rephrasing of the impugned entry will in anyway infringe violate any marriage to be entered into by muslim male and female under Mohamedan Law.

Pathology of the impugned entry:

20. The relevant part of the impugned kabinnama is inserted below:

21. The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (Ordinance No. VIII of 1961) promulgated to give effect to certain recommendations of the then Commission on Marriage and Family Laws ["the 1961 Ordinance"] in its section 5 made a provision for registration of marriages which was omitted by section 15 of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974 (Act No. LII of 1974) ["the 1974 Act"]. Pursuant to the promulgation of the 1961 Ordinance, the Muslim Family Laws Rules, 1961 were framed ["the 1961 Rules"]. Form -II appended to the said Rules was called Nikah-Nama that contained in clause (5) the following : ........ (5) Whether the bride is a maiden , a widow or a divorcee Translated in Bangla as (৫) কনে কুমারী, বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা

And for the bridegroom, there was no such provision, although in clause (21) it required "Whether the bride-groom has any existing wile..."

22. Subsequently, on 24th July, 1974, the 1974 Act came into being, pursuant to which on 1st July, 1975, the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Rules, 1975 ["the 1975 Rules"] were framed by the then Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Form E[nikahnama in Bangla] appended to the 1975 Rules contains a clause namely clause 5 that runs as follows:

"(৫) কনে কুমারী, বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা"
23. In contrast, the forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/divorced /previously married or is a virgin.

24. The Government vide SRO No. 201-Ain/2009 framed new Rules namely মুসলিম বিবাহ ও তালাক (নিবন্ধন) বিধিমালা, ২০০৯ ["the 2009 Rules"] by virtue of section 14 of the 1974 Act repealing the earlier rules/1975 Rules. Although the previous rules had been repealed, the form suggested therein contains the similar clause. Form Gha appended to the 2009 Rules reads, amongst the others, the following :

"(৫) কনে কুমারী, বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা ?..............
২১। বরের কোন স্ত্রী বর্তমানে আছে কি না এবং থাকিলে অন্য বিবাহে আবদ্ধ হইবার জন্য বর ১৯৬১ সালের মুসলিম পারিবারিক আইন অধ্যাদেশ মোতাবেক সালিসী কাউন্সিলের অনুমতি লইয়াছে কি না?...........
২২। অন্য বিবাহে আবদ্ধ হইবার জন্য সালিসী কাউন্সিলের নিকট হইতে বরের নিকট প্রেরিত অনুমতি পত্রের নম্বর ও তারিখ..........."
25. Although Muslim marriages and divorces are compulsorily registerable under laws now in force in Bangladesh, Hindu marriages have not been made compulsorily registerable as such under the newly enacted laws namely হিন্দু বিবাহ নিবন্ধন আইন, ২০১২ came into force on 27th January, 2013 and হিন্দু বিবাহ নিবন্ধন বিধিমালা, ২০১৩ came into force on 27th January, 2013. Clause 6 of the Form Gha appended to the Rules 2013 reads :

"৬। কন্যা কুমারী অথবা বিধবা কিনা?.........."
26. Now we should look into the dictionary meaning of the word - কুমারী. Bengali — English Dictionary, published by the Bangla Academy, June , 1994 defines the word at page 133 as under:

.n. 1. an unmarried girl of marriageable age, a virgin, a maiden. 2. Woman who remains single after the conventional age of marrying, a spinster, 3. A daughter : state of being a virgin; virginity...'

27. Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 7th Edition, 2005, Oxford University Press defines the word 'virgin' as: 'a person who has never had sex', and defines 'spinster' as " ..(old fashioned, often disappointing) a woman who is not married , especially an older woman who is not likely to many [this word should not now be used to mean simply a woman who is not married.. "

History of Bangladesh in respect of Registration of Muslim Marriages in this Region :

28. We have perused the relevant pages of Muslim Law in India and abroad authored by Dr. Tahir Mahmood (one of the most celebrated legal scholars in this sub-continent), he has summed up the history [at pages 53-65] of legislation in the field of muslim marriage and divorce in this region in a precise manner and style. Dr Mahmood writes

‘......... A Kazis Bill was introduced in the central legislature in 1879 with a long Statement of Objects and Reasons explaining why the government's power to appoint official kazis had been withdrawn, what problems its action had created, and why it was being resumed, the Kazi, in this country; before the advent of British rule, appears to have performed certain other duties, partly of a secular and partly of a religious nature. The principal function of these Kazis seems to have been preparing, attesting and registering deeds of transfer of property, celebrating marriages, and performing other rites and ceremonies. It is not apparent that any of these duties were incumbent on the Kazi as such. It is probable that the customary performance of them by him arose rather from his being a public functionary and one known by his official position to be acquainted with the law, than form his having, as Kazi, a greater claim to perform them than anyone else.

Such was the position of the Kazi in this country under Native Government. On the introduction of the British rule, Judges and Magistrates took the place of Kazis, and the Kazi in his judicial capacity disappeared. But the British Government, though no longer recognizing the judicial functions of the Kazi did not abolish the office. By certain Regulations passed from time to time the appointment of Kazi-ul Kuzat and Kazis by the State was provided for and the performance of their non-judicial duties was recognized by law.’

29. We note from the submission made by Mr M Belayet Hossain that currently there are Muslim Marriages and Divorce Registration Acts in force in six States of India for voluntary registration of marriages and divorces among the local Muslims. The States are: West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Orissa and Meghalaya. The parent Law among these is the old Bengal Mohammedan Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1876 which is now in force in the first three of the names States. The Orissa legislature re-enacted in 1949, with some changes, the old Bengal law of 1876 titles The Orissa Mohammedan Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1949 it extends to the whole State. The Assam legislature had enacted a similar law in 1935 titled: The Assam Moslem Marriage and Divorce Registration Act.

30. The 1876 Act made elaborate provisions for voluntary registration of marriages and divorces with the so-called Mohammedan Registrars, laid down their powers and function, and provided forms for registration by them. It empowered the provincial governments to make rules to provide other details for carrying out the purposes of the Act, which were soon issued. The Act was of an administrative nature and clarified the nature of its provisions in the following words:

Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed to:

(a) render invalid merely by reason of its not having been registered any Mohammedan marriage or divorce which could otherwise be valid;

(b) render valid by reason of its having been registered any Mohammedan marriage or divorce which could otherwise be invalid;

31. The most important provision of the Act was the one requiring the Mohammedan Registrars to periodically transmit their records to the District Registrars. The system was to be helpful in maintaining official records of marriages among the Muslims. The provision was borrowed mutatis mutandis, from the Christian Marriage Act 1872.

32. Unlike the Bengal Act of 1876, The Kazis Act does not provide any form for certification of marriages by the kazis. The kazis, both official and private, do keep forms of nikahnama [marriage agreement] but there is no uniform or standard form used for this purpose everywhere. The basic things mentioned in every nikahnama are names, age, parentage and address of parties and the amount and nature of dower. The document is signed by the parties or their vakils [guardians or their nominees] and gawahs [witnesses]. and authenticated by the kazi. The documents carry great weight as proof of marriage. Evidence of the kazis preparing nikahnama and the witnesses signing them is considered to be satisfactory proof of marriage.

33. The UN Convention for Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women promulgated in 1979 required all state parties to introduce measures for compulsory registration of marriages. The Indian government ratified the Convention but with some reservations in that matter. From 2006 onward the Supreme Court of India [without mentioning the government's reservation on the CEDAW provision] repeatedly issued directions that registration of all marriages among all communities should be made compulsory throughout India. Seema vs Ashwini kumar, AIR 2006 SC 1158.

34. Pre-Independence and Post-Independence positions in Bangladesh: Muslim Family Laws Ordinance: The Bengal, Bihar and Orissa Mohammedan Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1876 had remained in force in East Pakistan after the partition of India. No such law existed in any of the provinces of British India which as a result of partition of India in 1947 had become West Pakistan, and now constitute the whole of Pakistan. Only the central Kazis Act was extended to some places Under the Muslim family Laws ordinance promulgated by the federal government in Pakistan in 1961, and made applicable to both West and East Pakistan, section 5 provided for compulsory registration of all marriages in the country. Non registration would be punishable offence but will not affect the validity of marriage. After the creation of Bangladesh as a new State in 1972 the Ordinance remained in force there.

35. New Bangladesh Act: In 1973 Bangladesh amended the old Mohammedan Marriages and Divorces Registration of 1876, and next year replaced it with a new Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act 1974. The new Act repealed section 5 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961 [relating to registration of marriages] in its application in Bangladesh. Statutory rules under the new Act were framed in 1975 and amended on several occasions as we have seen above. Currently the 2009 Rules are in force.

36. Although the said States of the Union of India made several provisions for voluntary registration of muslim marriages, enactment of such law was halted in Jammu and Kashmir. THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR MUSLIM MARRIAGES REGISTRATIONACT, 1981 (Act No. XXII of 1981) was enacted in 1981 providing for compulsory registration, but had to be soon withdrawn due to stiff opposition by community leaders. Dr. Mahmood observes:

There is a feeling in Muslim religious circles that compulsory registration of a religious marriage would have the effect of converting it into a civil marriage no more to be governed by the personal law, due to which they have not been in favour of it. Their understanding of the matter is absolutely incorrect and they need to be properly educated about it. Whatever be the position of registration of marriages, voluntary or compulsory, it is merely an administrative process having nothing to do with any substantive aspect of marriage. Registration does not change a religious marriage into a civil marriage and even after registration it continues to be governed by the personal law of the parties.

37. It appears the SCHEDULE prescribed by the Act [under sections 2(a) and 3]. Contents to be maintained in a nikah registration form :

1. Place of marriage (with sufficient particulars to locate the Place.) 2. (a) Full name of the bride-groom. (b) His age. (c) His place of residence. (d) Address. (e) Full name of bridegroom's father. (f) Whether father is alive or dead. (g) Civil condition of the bridegroom at the time of marriage whether—Un-married, Widower Divorced Married, and if so, how many wives are alive. (h) Signature or thumb impression of the bridegroom/ Vakil/Guardian according as the Nikah was performed in person by the bridegroom or through his Vakil or Guardian. 3. (a) Full name of the bride. (b) Her age. (c) Her place of residence. (d) Address. (e) Full name of the bride's father. (f) Whether father is alive or dead. (g) Civil condition of the bride at the time of marriage whether—Un-married Widow Divorced. (h) Signature or thumb impression of the bride/Vakil/Guardian according as the Nikah was performed in person by the bride or through her Vakil or Guardian.

38. We may now have a look at the relevant parts of the Form used in registration of Muslim marriages in West Bengal. For ready reference the same is quoted below :

Schedule to the 1876 Act Muslims
(See sections 6 and 11)
Form A
Book I
Register of Marriages (as prescribed by section 6 of the Act for the voluntary registration of Mohammadan Marriages and Divorces).
4. Whether the bride is a spinster, a widow or divorced by a former husband and whether she is adult or otherwise.
5. [Name of the guardian of the bride-groom (if the bride-groom be a minor) and that of the guardian's father, with specification of the guardian's residence, and of the relationship in which he stands to the bride-groom.]
6. [Name of the guardian of the bride (if she be a minor) and that of his father, with specification of his residence, and the relationship in which he stands to the bride.]

39. The form used in West Bengal for registration of Muslim marriages uses the word -'spinster' in place of kumari, considering the definition given by the Oxford Dictionary (quoted above) it may be reasonably concluded that both `virgin' and 'spinster' are equally degrading.

Constitutional aspects and international obligations in respect of gender equality: is the impugned entry to the kabinnama violative of the Constitutional and international obligations?

40. Ours is a Constitutional democracy where constitutionalism and rule of law prevail. In its preamble, and in Part II and III, the Constitution clearly spelt out the type of society that was the dream of the framers and the leaders of the independence movement. The preamble declared that it shall be a fundamental aim of the State to realise through the democratic process a socialist society, free from exploitation a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens.

41. Article 7 says, "The Constitution is the Supreme law of the Republic and if any law is inconsistent with the Constitution, the other law, shall to the extent of the inconsistency, be void." Article 11 provides that the Republic shall be a democracy in which fundamental human rights and freedoms and respect for the dignity and worth of human person shall be guaranteed. Further, our Constitution in Article 27 in clear and unambiguous terms provides that All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. Article 26 reads: All existing law inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, become void on the commencement of this Constitution.

42. Constitution not only guarantees equality of all citizens irrespective of sex, religion etc, but also provides for special arrangements for the backward classes. Article 28 provides: (1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only on religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth: (2) Women shall have equal rights with men in all spheres of the State and of public life; (3) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth be subjected to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to access to any place of public entertainment or resort, or admission to any educational institution. (4) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making special provision in favour of women or children or for the advancement of any backward section of citizens.

43. Article 31 guarantees treatment in accordance with law, right to PRIVACY etc. It reads:

“....... To enjoy the protection of the law, and to be treated in accordance with law, and only in accordance with law, is the inalienable right of every citizen , wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time being within Bangladesh, and in particular no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law ..........”
44. Now we should be looking into the international obligations of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh vis-à-vis gender equality, equal protection of law, non-discriminatory treatment towards women members of the Republic. Bangladesh ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1984 and has submitted seven progress reports on its implementation and participated in meetings of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (herein after the Committee).

45. The Eighth Periodic Report of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Submitted Under Article 18 in 2015 contains, inter cilia:

‘....... 34. In addition to legal measures to maintain equality, equal protection of law; and non discrimination, institutions and measures are in place as follows:

35. National Council for Women and Children Development (NCWCD): National Council for Women Development (NCWD), chaired by the Honorable Prime Minister and consisting of representatives of government, civil society, and women's organizations was merged in 2009 with the National Council for Child Development (NCCD) and was named the National Council for Women and Children Development (NCWCD). The NCWCD provides policy guidance and monitors the implementation of critical policy decisions on women's and children's development.

36. Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MOWCA): MOWCA is the nodal ministry for gender governance and acts as the lead ministry in promoting gender equality. MOWCA coordinates the response by all government agencies to the needs and priorities of women and implements policies and programme& through its three agencies, Department of Women Affairs (DWA), Jatiya Mohila Shangstha (JMS) and Bangladesh Shishu Academy (BSA). A Policy Leadership and Advocacy Unit (PLAU) provides technical support to MOWCA in coordinating women's advancement activities within the Government. The Annex D shows the existing institutional mechanism.

37. Other mechanisms: Other institutional mechanisms such as Parliamentary Standing Committee for MOWCA and Women In Development Focal Point (WIDFP), WIDFP Implementation and Evaluation Committee (WIDFPIEC), Women In Development Focal Point Coordination Committee (WIDFPCC) and Women In Development Focal Point Network Committee (WIDFPNC) are in place. The WIDFPs of all ministries lead to address gender concerns within the policies and plans of their respective ministries.

38. Development Plans: Equality is promoted through implementation of development plans. The Perspective Plan (2010-2021) provides framework for the implementation of the Government's Vision 2021....”

46. In that premises, we are of the view that the Government is pledge bound to and under an obligation to protect the rights of women and to ensure gender equality in all spheres of the Republic.

47. The content and ambit of the great equalising principle enunciated in article 27 is wide. There can be no doubt that it is a founding faith of the Constitution, our apex Court in several decisions have held that it is the pillar on which rests securely the foundation of our democratic Republic. It was held in Shayara Bano vs Union of India reported in (2017) 9 SCC 1 that Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits.

48. We coincide with what was pointed out by the majority in EP Royappa vs State of TN reported in (1974) 4 SCC 3:

‘........... From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14....'

49. Nariman, J holds in Shayara Banos case Article 14 (our article 27) strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article 14. It must be "right and just and fair" and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive; otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied."

50. We are of the view that the fundamental right to equality guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution, manifested within its fold equality of status. Gender equality, gender equity and gender justice are values intrinsically entwined in the guarantee of equality under the Constitutional realm, the rights of a Muslim women to human dignity, social esteem and self-worth are vital facets of a woman's right to life with dignity, under Articles 27, 28, 31 and 32 of the Constitution. It was submitted that gender justice was a constitutional goal of overwhelming importance and magnitude, without accomplishing the same, half of the country's citizenry, would not able to enjoy to the fullest—their rights, status and opportunities. That gender equality and the dignity of women are non-negotiable, they are necessary not only to realise the aspirations of every individual woman, who is an equal citizen of this country, but also, for the larger well-being of society and the progress of the nation, one-half of which is made up by women. The basic structure permeates equality of status and opportunity. Personal laws are derived not from the Constitution but from the religious scriptures. Human rights and fundamental freedom have been reiterated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and have mutual reinforcement. It was held in the Triple Talaq Case (mentioned above): the human rights for women, including girl child are, therefore, inalienable, integral and 'indivisible part of universal human rights. The full development of personality and fundamental freedoms and equal participation by women in political, social, economic and cultural life are concomitants for national development, social and family stability and growth, culturally, socially and economically. All forms of discrimination on grounds of gender is violative of fundamental freedoms and human rights." We take the view that Articles 26, 27, 28, 31 are inseparable part of the basic structure of the Constitution. These values the right to equality, non-discrimination and the right to live life with dignity forms (he bedrock of the Constitution. Furthermore, gender equality and dignity for women is an inalienable and inseparable part of the basic structure of the Constitution, the most fundamental facet of equality under the Constitution was gender equality and gender equity. Thus we do not find any difficulty in striking out the impugned entry from the impugned kabinnama.

51. The next issue we like to deal with is PRIVACY. Although the word has not been used in our Constitution as it is, it is implied in the words and phrases of Articles 11 and 32 as dignity, reputation and privacy are part and parcel of right to life. It was held in Govind vs State, reported in AIR 1975 SC 1378:

‘.......... The right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through a process of cast by case development. Therefore, even assuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and freedom of speech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation from them which one can characterize as a fundamental right we do not think that the right is absolute a right to privacy is itself a fundamental right...'

52. Similarly in Mr 'X' vs Hospital 'Z', reported in AIR 1999 SC 495, it was held:‘......... Right of privacy may apart from contract, also arise out of a particular specific relationship which may be commercial, matrimonial, or even political. As already discussed above. Doctor-patient relationship, though basically commercial, is professionally, a matter of confidence and therefore, Doctors are morally and ethically bound to maintain confidentiality. In such a situation, public disclosure of even true private facts may amount to an invasion of the Right of Privacy which may sometimes lead to the clash of one person's right to be let alone" with another person. Disclosure of even true private facts has the tendency to disturb a person's tranquility. It may generate many complexes in him and may even lead to psychological problems. He may thereafter, have disturbed life all through. In the face of these potentialities and as already held by this Court in its various decisions referred to above. The Right of Privacy is an essential component of right to life envisaged by Article 21. The right however is no absolute and may be lawfully restricted for the prevention of crime, disorder or protection of health or morals or protection of rights and freedom of others...'

53. It was held in R. Rajagopal vs State of TN reported in AIR 1995 SC 264 :

‘.......... The right to privacy as an independent and distinctive concept originated in the field of Tort Law, under which a new cause of action for damages resulting from unlawful invasion of privacy was recognized. This right has two aspects which are but two faces of the same coin: (1) the general law of privacy which affords a tort action for damages resulting from an unlawful invasion of privacy and (2) the constitutional recognition given to the right to privacy which protects personal privacy against unlawful governmental invasion. In recent times, however, this right has acquired a constitutional status ..........’

54. In a recent judgment of one of this Court's Division Bench [6 CLR (HCD) (2018) Nurjahan Ruzi vs Bangladesh (per Mr Syed Refaat Ahmed, J)] the issue of right to privacy has been discussed. The Court held :

‘......... It is this Court's finding that such balance was indeed not struck in the facts by the Respondent No.6 and this stemmed from not only a misconceived requirement of disclosure of personal status by the applicant-Petitioner but also a misdirected inquiry into the primacy of her marital status in the facts. It is here that this Court finds that the requirement under the law is of a disclosure of marital status current and extant-as-evident from an existing sate of wedlock at the material time i.e., on the date of submission of the application of External Cadet Sub-Inspector It appears to this Court that the Respondents have veered towards an unauthorized scrutiny on that latter circumstance, thereby, unduly, unreasonably and unfairly burdening the petitioner with an obligation of disclosure not sanctioned or required in law.'

55. As we note from the submission made by the learned Counsel Mr Hossain, dignity and privacy are important values promoted by Islamic faith. It was submitted : ‘....... It is the girl's right to make a decision concerning her marriage, and her father or guardian is not permitted to override her objections or ignore her wishes. Prying into other peoples' private affairs and spying on their secrets is not permitted, even if they are engaged in sin, as long as long as they do it privately and not openly. Uqbah then said, 'Woe to you! Do not do that, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him) say, If one conceals the private affairs (of others), it is like reviving a girl who has been buried alive from her grave. [The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam By Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi at pages 314-316, 321-322] . The Islamic jurist further writes : During the Farewell pilgrimage the Prophet (peace be on him) addressed the asembly of Muslims, saying, Your lives, your honour, and your property are as sacred to each other as the sacredness of this your day, in this your month, and in this your city.

56. The impugned forms at clause No. 5 require the bride to make a statement as to her marital status and her sexual history, specifically stating whether she is virgin/widowed/divorced should be re-phrased for the sake of removal of the degrading and discriminatory entries. The forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/ divorced /previously married or is a Celibate. It is discriminating and arbitrary and created inequality violating the said provisions of the Constitution, negating the CEDAW obligations. Such requirements are violative of fundamental rights, in particular the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sex, the right to be treated in accordance with law, as guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution. Interference with such privacy also violates a women's right to personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 31 and 32 of the constitution. Inclusion of the Word "Kumari" instead of "Unmarried" is humiliating and degrading to the woman's personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 32 of the Constitution and contradicts with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) inasmuch as it has the effect of discrimination against woman on the basis of sex, also impairing the dignity of woman by invading upon their privacy.

57. However, since the Government vide SRO No. 84-Ain/2011 dated 10th April, 2011 inserted the following to the impugned kabinnama forms, the other terms of the Rule (with respect to the identities of the parties to a marriage etc.) are not required to be dealt with:

"৩। [জন্ম নিবন্ধন সনদ/জাতীয় পরিচয়পত্র/জুনিয়র স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (জে.এস.সি) বা মাধ্যমিক স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (এস.এস.সি) বা সমমানের পরীক্ষার সনদপত্র/মাতা, পিতা বা আইনগত অভিভাবক প্রদত্ত বয়স সংক্রান্ত হলফনামা অনুযায়ী বরের বয়স...............
৬। [জন্ম নিবন্ধন সনদ/জাতীয় পরিচয়পত্র/জুনিয়র স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (জে.এস.সি) বা মাধ্যমিক স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (এস.এস.সি) বা সমমানের পরীক্ষার সনদপত্র/মাতা, পিতা বা আইনগত অভিভাবক প্রদত্ত বয়স সংক্রান্ত হলফনামা অনুযায়ী কনার বয়স............"
This Court's declaration:

58. In view of the position expressed above, we are satisfied that this is a case which presents a situation where this Court should exercise its discretion to issue appropriate directions under Article-102 of the Constitution.

Thus the entry No. 5 in Forms No. 1601 is hereby declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect being discriminatory against women on the ground of sex and marital status in violation of Articles 28, 31 and 32 of the Constitution; The Respondents are hereby directed to take necessary action (preferably within a period of 6 (six) months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment) :

(i)to amend the entry No.5 in Bangladesh Forms No. 1601 (ফরম-খ) (Form-Kha) (kabinnama) appended to the Rules, by omitting the word "Kumari" in respect of brides, and be replaced with the following:

"5. Marital Status of the Bride: [Unmarried/ Divorced/Widow?
...... [In Bangla: কন্যা অবিবাহিতা বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা]

to insert the following in the said forms: "21. Marital Status of the Bridegroom: [Married/Unmarried/Divorced/Widower?] In Bangla : বর বিবাহিত/অবিবাহিত/তালাকপ্রাপ্ত/বিপত্নীক কিনা in the beginning of entry No. 21 keeping the existing sentence intact.

59. With these observations and directions, the Rule is disposed of.

60. The office is directed to communicate the order at once.

61. No order as to costs.

Khizir Ahmed Choudhury, J:

I have gone through the judgment authored by my lord Ms. Justice Naima Haider and I fully agree with the findings and ultimate result of the instant Rule but I would like to dwell some aspects which has bearing in the instant Rule.

63. In Form having framed under "Muslim Marriage and Talak Registration Rules 2009", some discriminatory remarks has been inserted in clause 5 which militates with clause 21 of the said form having clearly dealt in the findings of the judgment. Article 26 of the constitution of the People Republic of Bangladesh also clearly prohibits from making any law inconsistent with any provisions of the part 111 titled as "fundamental rights" which runs as follows:

1. All existing law inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, become void on the commencement of this Constitution.

2. The state shall not make any law inconsistent with any provisions of this Part, and any law so made shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.

3. ...........

64. As per Article 152 of the Constitution "Muslim Marriage and Talak registration rules 2009" is also law and, as such, remarks made in column 5 of form "Gha" to the effect that "কন্যা কুমারী" being discriminatory cannot be sustained.

65. Apart from this Article 27 also stipulates that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. Article 28 also postulates that the state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth and also stipulates that woman shall have equal rights with men in all spheres of the state and public life. Equally, Article 31 mandates that all citizens will enjoy protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law and only in accordance with law.

66. Another important aspect is that under Mohammadan law Muslim Marriage is a contract and it is necessary that the men or someone on his behalf and the women or someone on her behalf should agree to the marriage at one meeting and the said agreement should be witnessed by two adult witnesses. It can be termed a Civil contract but with passage of time and changed circumstances registration of marriages has became necessary and consequently in our country "the Muslim Marriage and divorce Registration Act 1974" has been enacted wherein section 3 of the said act finds provision for registration of marriages and also Nikah Registers are entrusted for registration of marriages and divorces. Consequent to the said act successive rules have been framed under which marriage and divorce are registered under specific forms and presently it is being done under " ফরম ‘ঘ’ মুসলিম বিবাহ ও তালাক (নিবন্ধন) বিধিমালা, ২০০৯ এর বিধি ২৮(১) (ক) অনুযায়ী বিবাহ রেজিস্টারী বহি”, So as the terms referred to in the said form Gha namely "কন্যা কুমারী" is not mandate of Muslim law, it should be deleted for harmonizing the status of bride and bride groom.

Consequently, from all perimeters it is amply clear that remarks made in clause 5 in form “ঘ” namely "কন্যা কুমারী " is clearly discriminatory and against the avowed spirit of our constitution and, as such, this inconsistent remark requires to be deleted.

End.

Though the petitioner tried to sit with them in Cox's Bazar Bar Association in several times but in vain. That the petitioner finding no other way cancelled the Irrevocable Power of Attorney on 11-9-2009 vide registered deed No. 25-12-2007. That the petitioner filed Mutation Case No. 1205 of 2006 and mutated his name in the B S. Khatian No. 4706 and the petitioner has been paying rents to the concerned authority regularly. That the petitioner filed an application to the respondents for permission to sell the allotted plot, against the said application to the Ministry of Housing and Public Works and the ministry issued a letter to the Executive Engineer, Cox's Bazar vide Memo No. sha-9/1- M- 26/2008/302 dated 7-5-2008 to send elaborate report regarding the ownership of the land.

That on 20-1-2016 the petitioner sent a Notice Demanding Justice through registered post with acknowledgement document and by special messenger to the respondents No.1-3 and prayed that the respondents permit the petitioner to sell the schedule property. That the respondent No. 3 issued a letter vide memo No. Shakha-9/1M-26/2008/38 dated 21-1-2016 to the petitioner denying to permit to transfer the schedule land with a malafide and arbitrary intention. That the said letter is impugned herein. Hence the writ petition.

6. Learned Advocate Mr Mr Sherder Abul Hossain, Advocate with Mr Md Ashraful Islam, Advocate with Mr Tanjil Mahmud, Advocate appeared for the petitioner while learned DAG Mr Noor Us Sadik Chowdhury along with Mr Prahlad Debnath AAG along with Mr Md Hafizur Rahman, AAG along with Ms. Farida Parvin Flora, AAG appeared for the respondent Nos. 1-7 and learned Advocate Mr Md Musharraf Hossain Mozumder appeared for the respondent No.9 .

7. Learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the final refusal in not allowing him to transfer the property vide memo no. Shakha-9/1M-26/2008/38, dated 21-1-2016 which is Annexure -H issued by the respondent No. 3 is without lawful authority and not sustainable. He agitates that the respondent No. 3 by his order dated 21-1-2016 refusing to allow the petitioner to transfer the property is arbitrary and is a slip shod order. He draws attention to Annexurer H and submits that the respondent No. 3 did not anywhere mention in his order their reason for not allowing the petitioner to transfer his property. He contends that admittedly the petitioner is still a lessee having being allotted the land in 1980 and has been continuing as a lawful lessee since over a period of 40 years. Upon a query from the bench regarding the respondent's contention as to some pending suits between the instant petitioner and some other individuals (persons), the learned Advocate for the petitioner agitated that whatever suit/case may be pending between the petitioner and some other individual/person do not concern the respondent Nos. 1-7 at all. He argues that such pending suit involve issues which are disputed matter of fact to be decided in the concerned civil court. He agitates that so far the respondents are concerned admittedly the petitioner still a lessee and the land is duly mutated in his name upon payment of rent, taxes, DCR etc. and which is clear from Annexure E of the writ petition. He draws attention to Annexure E which is an enquiry conducted by the respondents. He contends that nowhere in the enquiry report is there any negative indication or remark on any malafide nor any latches on the part of the petitioner. He continues that from the enquiry report it is clear that the property pursuant to allotment was duly mutated in the petitioners name followed by payment of rent, taxes, DCR etc in the name of petitioner who is the lawful and admitted lessee.

8. Upon another query from this bench regarding the respondent's contention that clauses 19 and 17 of the Lease Deed dated 27-12-1980 was not complied with, he argues that nowhere in the enquiry report nor by way of any other evidences could it shown be that clauses 19 and 17 was not complied with.

9. Regarding the issue of power of attorney granted by the petitioner to some other person subsequent to allotment, the learned Advocate for the petitioner strenuously argued that Power of Attorney is a legal right and which does not require any permission from the respondents. He submits that subsequent to any allotment of property power of attorney can be lawfully granted to any person for sake of convenience whatsoever for purpose of construction of building or any other reason. He reiterates that since after 40 years of the original allotment admittedly the petitioner is still a lawful lessee therefore the respondents have no legal right in not allowing him to transfer the property moreover without assigning any valid reason. He further submits that the allotment has not been cancelled and which is contemplated in clause 22 of the lease deed in the event of any default by the petitioner. He continues that therefore it is evident that the petitioner pursuant to the allotment by granting another person power by way of power of attorney to construct building on his behalf whatsoever, however did not deviate or otherwise depart from the terms of the deed. He submits that since the allotment has not been terminated therefore it is to be presumed that clauses 19 and 20 and also 22 of the lease deed was complied with. He argued that therefore it is the lawful right of the petitioner to obtain permission from the Respondents. He agitates that the respondent no. 3 without assigning any reason by way of slip shod order arbitrarily and whimisically refused the petitioner. He concludes his submission upon assertion that the Rule bears merit ought to be made absolute for ends of justice.

10. On the other hand, learned AAG Mr Prahlad Devnath appearing for the respondent No. 1-7 by way of filing affidavit in opposition opposes the Rule. From the affidavit in opposition he however mainly submits on some factual matters pertaining to some suits pending between the petitioner and some other individuals/persons. He submits that since some suits are pending between the petitioner and some others therefore pending the suit the respondents are not in a position to transfer the land. He further submits that the petitioners did not comply with some relevant clauses of the lease deed which stipulate a time of 2(two) years from the date of allotment to construct on the leased land and therefore the petitioner may not be allowed to lawfully transfer the property. He further submits that the petitioner did not act lawfully since he granted power of attorney to some other person after allotment of the property and further there are some pending suits between the petitioner and some other persons in the lower court. He made some other factual submissions regarding the reason of the respondents refusal not to allow the petitioner to transfer the land. Upon a query from this bench as to whether the respondents still acknowledge the petitioner as their lessee? the learned Assistant Attorney-General however concedes and admits that the petitioner is still a lessee of the government(Respondents). He concludes his submission upon assertion that however the Rule bears no merits ought to be discharged for ends of justice.

11. The learned Advocate for the respondent No. 9 who is the purchaser of the property from the petitioner substantively support the contention of the learned Advocate for the Respondents and concludes his submission upon assertion that the Rule bears no merit and ought to be made Absolute for ends of justice.

12. We have heard the learned Advocates for all sides, perused the application and materials on records. It is an admitted fact by both the parties that whatever the reason of refusal to transfer may be however the petitioner is still a lessee of the government since 1980.

13. For purpose of proper disposal of the Rule we have examined the lease deed which has been annexed as Annexure-A and which is dated 20-10-1980. For our purpose we have examined Clauses 3, 19, 20 and 22 of the lease deed. Clauses 3, 19, 20 and 22 of the lease deed reproduced hereunder:

"(3) That the constructions to be made on the demised property shall not cover more than two-thirds of the demised property and within two years from the date of commencement of the lease or within such further time as the Lessor may allow in his discretion, the tenant shall complete the building on the demised property of a house with all necessary outhouses, boundary marks , drains and appurtenance for the purpose of a residence including a septic tank of a pattern approved by the Chief Engineer, Public Works Department."

"(19) That the tenant shall not sell, charge, mortgage, exchange, gift away otherwise assign, sublet, encumber or in any way part with or dispose of the demise property or any part thereof before the construction of the buildings, outhouses and appurtenances hereby covenanted to be erected."

"(20) That subject to the provision of clause 19, the tenant shall be at liberty to transfer or sublet subject to the conditions of these presents the whole of the demised property subject to the obligation that the transfer shall be registered in the office of such authority as may be appointed by the lessor, and unless this is done the lessor will not be bound to recognise or accept any person as tenant of the demised property in place of the transferor."
14. Clause 3 of the lease deed contemplate that the property pursuant to being allotted t42 the lessee the lessee must construct on at least /3rd within a period of 2(two) years. Clause 19 and 20 of the lease deed also consist of similar provision. Clause 19 of the lease deed contemplate that in the absence of constructing house in the property the petitioner shall not have any right to transfer the property. Clause 20 of the lease deed however contemplate that subject to construction by way of building etc. in the land the lessee (tenant) shall be at liberty to transfer or sublet the property in whole or in part thereof whatsoever and in the case of transfer, the property shall be duly registered. It also contemplates that in the absence of registration the lessor shall not be bound to acknowledge the new transferee or new lessee whatsoever.

15. We have particularly perused clause 22 of the lease deed which contemplates that in case of failure to construct building within the stipulated time of 2(two) years, if any lessee fails to perform his part within that time the respondents shall be at liberty to terminate the lease and following such termination shall proceed accordingly with the relevant laws.

16. Now as mentioned above in this case the petitioner admittedly is still a lessee and which is conceded and admitted by the respondent government. In our considered opinion since the petitioner is admittedly still a lessee since 1980 and since his allotment has not yet been cancelled therefore it may be presumed and concluded that the petitioner did not deviate from the prescribed clause. We may safely presume that the petitioner followed the conditions in clause Nos. 3, 4, 19, 20 and other relevant clauses of the lease deed. It is only reasonable and logical to hold that if the petitioner was not in compliance with the conditions and terms of the lease deed, the lease deed would have been terminated by dint of clause 4 of the lease deed. But however the petitioner in this case is till date a lawful and legal lessee as admitted by the respondents.

17. Truly enough permission is required in accordance with the lease deed and under the other relevant laws. Before transferring any property the lessee is required to obtain permission from the concerned authority. However it must be borne in mind that refusing to allow transfer a property cannot be done arbitrarily and particularly in this case the petitioner has been an allottee since 1980 and a lawful lessee. While his refusing to be allowed permission to transfer his property the respondents must assign a cogent reason. In this case it is clear by way of Annexure-H dated 21-1-2016 that the respondents did not assign any reason. The order dated 21-1-2016 which is annexure-H denying the petitioner to allow him to transfer is a slip shod order with no explanation at all. Further we have examined the enquiry report (Annexure E). Upon careful examination of the findings of the enquiry report dated 21-8-2008 we do not find any negative comment against the present petitioner. It appears that the enquiry report expressly stated that pursuant to the allotment the lessee (petitioner here) have been paying taxes, DCR etc.

18. As to the power of Attorney being granted to some other person it is common knowledge that a power of attorney is a common factor and is often granted by the owner to some other person to construct/ sell or otherwise supervise the property for sake of convenience. We do not find anywhere anything in any other law which may indicate that permission is required from the respondents/authorities to grant power of attorney. Apparently the enquiry report found that there is a construction building also thereupon in the demised land. Therefore it may be safely concluded that the petitioner complied with the conditions/terms of the lease deed. Since the lease is still continuing and has not been cancelled therefore it is evident that the petitioners complied with the rules and conditions.

19. The learned AAG on behalf of the respondents agitated that there are some pending suits between the petitioner and some other person and for that reason transfer of the property to any other person is not possible.

20. It is a settled principle of law that property may be transferred by any person/ lessee/owner whatsoever to some other person even pending a suit. However it is also a settled principle of law that if there are any pending cases involved in that event the purchaser shall purchase or otherwise obtain the property from the transferor with all its rights and liabilities attached to such property whatsoever. Therefore the transferor may purchase the property and shall be transposed in the possession of the original lessee and he shall purchase the property pending any suit and the fate of the original suit shall decide the fate of the subsequent transferee of the property. Therefore the purchaser shall purchase the property bearing in mind that the fate of the property shall be decided depending on the fate of the suit.

21. From the foregoing discussions made above and under the facts and circumstances we are of the considered view that we do not see any legal bar nor any other bar as to why the petitioner cannot transfer the property to any other person. The respondent No. 3 by his slip shod order dated 21-1-2016 which is annexed as Annexure-H in the writ petition committed illegality in not allowing the petitioner to transfer the Plot No.50, Block-A, measuring an area of 5 Kathas of Mouza Jhilongjha, Upazila-Cox's Bazar, Cox's Bazar Sea Beach Area. He gave a slip shod and non speaking order. We find merit in this Rule.

22. In the result, the Rule is made absolute with direction and relying on the observations made above. The impugned letter vide Memo No. Shakha-9/IM-26/2008/38 dated 21-1-2016 issued by the respondent No. 3 which is marked as Annexure-H in the writ petition is hereby declared without lawful authority and if of no legal effect. The respondent Nos. 1-7 are hereby directed to permit the petitioner to transfer the Plot No. 50 , Block-A, Measuring an area of 5 Kathas of Mouza Jhilongjhc Upazila-Cox's Bazar, Cox's Bazar Sea Beach Area within a period of 90(ninety) days from the date of receiving of this judgment. Communicate this judgment at once.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BANGLADESH

High Court Division

(Civil Miscellaneous Jurisdiction)

First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 33 of 2021
With
Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020

City Bank Limited, represented by its Managing Director (Appellant)
VS
SM Delwar Hossain (Respondent)

Present:
Mr. Justice Md. Rezaul Hasan

Judgment Date: September 27, 2021

Md Sameer Sattar, Advocate For the Appellant.

Md Akteruzzaman, Advocate For the Respondent.
JUDGMENT
Md Rezaul Hasan, J: This appeal is directed against the impugned judgment and order No. 34 dated 22-1-2017, passed by the Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Bogura, in Miscellaneous Review Case No. 02 of 2014 (arising out of Civil Revision No.24 of 2013) allowing the Review and, thereby, giving effect to the order No.13 dated 21-1-2013, passed by the Senior Assistant Judge, 1st Court, Bogura, in Civil Suit No.390 of 2011.

2. Facts, relevant for disposal of this First Miscellaneous Appeal, in brief, are that, one SM Delowar Hossain filed Civil Suit No.390 of 2011 before the court of 1st Assistant Judge, Bogura, against the Managing Director, City Bank Limited and 3 others, praying for declaration that the termination order dated 14-7-2011, whereby the services of the plaintiff has been ended, is illegal, collusive, without jurisdiction, void, malafide, ineffective and not binding upon him. The plaintiff has also prayed for direction for payment of his salary as well as other reliefs, which he may be entitled to as per law. The case of the plaintiff is that, he was appointed as "Cash Sorter" on 27-9-1990, on probation, and thereafter his service was confirmed on 4-5-1991. Subsequently, the Bank has promoted him to the post of Senior Cash Officer. Later on, he was transferred to Bogura Branch against the post of "Chief Retailer". His further case is that, he has rendered his services with the satisfaction of the superior authority and has been enjoying his salary and other benefits accordingly. But, on 13-7-2011, when the plaintiff went to join his duty at Bogura Branch, he was prevented from joining and was asked to go to the Head Office. He then went to the Head Office of the Bank. But, Mr Jabed Amin and Head of Policy Ms. Khil Khil Newa detained him and compelled him to submit a resignation letter. Further case of the plaintiff is that, he lodged a GD entry on 23-7-2011, wherein he has stated all these facts and he was removed from the services in the name of termination, most arbitrarily and inhumanly and without issuing any prior notice. In these circumstances, causes of action has arisen and he was compelled to file this suit.

3. The defendants contested in the suit by filing written statement, on 26-11-2012, in which, they have denied all allegations made in the plaint and stated their own case at paragraph No. 10 of the written statements. The defence case, in brief, is that, the Bank is a juristic person and that it has a Service Rule applicable to the bank employees. According to that Service Rule, the Bank can terminate the services of any employee, including the plaintiff, as per clause 9.2.3, which is the privilege of the employer. Further case of the defendant was that, the plaintiff was not dismissed from his services and he was paid 3(three) month's salary, in lieu of 3(three) months notice period and was given other benefits as were admissible as per law. Accordingly, the plaintiff has no case, nor any cause of action to file this suit and he is not entitled to get any relief as prayed for.

4. Along with the written statement, the defendants have filed an application under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, (Annexure-D) for rejection of the plaint alleging that, the plaintiff has been terminated as per the Service Rules of the bank and he was given all service benefits as per the Service Rules and that it was a termination simpliciter. Therefore, the plaint is liable to be rejected.

5. The trial court heard the parties on this application for rejection of the plaint. It was of the opinion that, the plaintiff has served in the Bank for long period and there was no adverse remarks on his service report. The trial court has also recorded that no notice was served upon the plaintiff, nor he was given any opportunity to show cause. On these findings, the trial court had rejected the application for rejection of the plaint, vide its judgment and order dated 21-1-2013.

6. Against the said judgment and order of the trial court, the Bank preferred Civil Revision No. 24 of 2013, before the District Judge, Bogura. Being transferred, the Civil Revision No. 24 of 2013 was heard by the Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Bogura, who, in presence of both the parties, had allowed the civil revision by its judgment and order dated 23-3-2014, on contest, and had set-aside the judgment and order of the trial court dated 21-1-2013. Against the said order of the lower revisional court, the plaintiff has filed Miscellaneous Review Case No. 2 of 2014 before the same court (Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Bogura). The lower revisional court, after hearing the review petition, vide it's judgment and order dated 22-1-2017, has allowed the application for review, set-aside the judgment and order dated 21-1-2013, passed revision, and upheld the judgment and order dated 21-3-2013 of the trial court.

7. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order of the revisional court dated 22-1-2017, the Bank has filed this application under section 115(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which was subsequently converted into First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 33 of 2021 by an order dated 4-12-2019, whereupon the Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020 has been issued.

8. Both the First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 33 of 2021 and Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020 have been taken up for analogous hearing and disposal.

9. Learned Advocate Mr Sameer Satter appeared for the defendant-appellant. He, having placed the Memo of Appeal alongwith other documents annexed thereto, 1st of all submits that, a mere perusal of the termination letter will show that, this was termination simpliciter and the plaintiff was given service benefit in lieu of 90 days notice period as well as other benefits admissible in This case. He also submits that, termination of service is a privilege of the employer and this is permitted by Clause No. 9.2.3 of the Service Rules of the Bank. He next submits that, this suit filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable and if a terminated employee is allowed to file a suit then it will open a flood-gate to file several cases, while termination is a mode recognized to relieve on from his job. He also submits that, the trial court has utterly failed to understand the legal aspect of this case and it had erroneously passed the order dated 21-1-2013. He also submits that, no stigma or any kind of blame has been imposed upon the plaintiff. Therefore, he continues, the plaintiff had no cause of action, moreso when he has been paid all his service benefit as per Rules and Regulations of the Bank. He next submits that, the revisional court has discussed the case of both the parties as well as it had considered the decisions cited before it and had arrived at a correct judgment and order dated 23-3-2014. But, the learned Advocate submits that, the revisional court ought not to have admitted the Review Case No. 02 of 2014 in as much as the condition laid down in Order 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for entertaining an application for review, did not exist in this case. Moreover, the said Review Petition No. 02 of 2014 has not been filed upon any of the grounds enumerated in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and, therefore, the revisional court, in admitting the Review Petition No.02 of 2014, has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it and the impugned judgment and order dated 22-10-2017, whereby it has set-aside it's own judgment and order dated 23-3-2014 passed in Civil Revision No.24 of 2013. He next submits that, once the revisional court has passed the order dated 24-10-2013 it has become functus-officio. Therefore, the learned Advocate submits that, in passing the impugned judgment and order dated 22-1-2017, passed in Review Petition No. 02 of 2014, the lower revisional court has committed grave error of law, that has resulted in error in the decision passed as well as it has occasioned in a serious failure of justice. Moreover, it has created a bad precedence by setting aside it's own order in purported exercise of the review jurisdiction when none of the grounds were available. He concludes that, this appeal has merit and the same may kindly be allowed.

10. Learned Advocate Mr Md Akter-uz-zaman has appeared on behalf of the respondent-opposite party. He, on the other hand, submits that, the trial court has rightly passed the judgment and order dated 21-1-2013, whereby it has rejected the application for rejection of the plaint. He next submits that, the order dated 21-1-2013 of the trial court is a speaking order and the plaintiff served in the Bank for a long period and there is no earthly reason to terminate his service and his termination is not in the interest of the Bank. He next submits that, the revisional court, vide it's judgment and order dated 23-3-2014, passed in Civil Revision No. 24 of 2013, although set-aside the order of the trial court in Review Petition No. 02 of 2014, it has reassessed the entire case of the parties and has rightly allowed the review application on contest and thereby it has secured the ends of justice. As such, the impugned judgment and order passed by the court below, in exercise of it's review jurisdiction, do not call for any interference by this Court. He next submits that, the plaintiff is an officer of the Bank and was promoted to the higher post because of his meritorious career and an employee cannot be left to the caprices of the Bank Management. Moreover, the learned Advocate proceeds on that, the Bank has not given any release letter to the plaintiff which shows a clear case of malafide exercise of the power. He next submits that, the defendants have violated the direction given in the BRPD Circular Letter No. 07 dated 28th May, 2015, issued by Bangladesh Bank. Besides, he further submits that, the defendants have denied to the plaintiff the opportunity to re-pay the house loan by installments to be deducted from his salary during continuation of his service and has denied to him his livelihood. He concludes that, this appeal has no merit and the same is liable to be dismissed and the Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2021 may kindly be discharged.

11. I have heard the learned Advocates appearing for both the parties, perused the Memo of Appeal, application for stay and the documents annexed to the petition and other materials on record.

12. I find from the termination letter that it is apparently a termination simpliciter and the plaintiff was given service benefit in lieu of 90 days notice period.

13. In the light of the facts and circumstances of this case, as revealed from the pleadings of the parties and the materials available in the record, I have taken into consideration the BRPD Circular Letter No. 07 dated 28th May, 2015, that reads as follows:

"ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক/প্রধান নির্বাহী, বাংলাদেশ কার্যরত সব তফসিলী ব্যাংক।
প্রিয় মহোদয়,
ব্যাংকে পরিপালনের জন্য কতিপয় নির্দেশনা প্রসঙ্গে।
সাম্প্রতিককালে লক্ষ্য করা যাচ্ছে যে, ব্যাকিং সময়সূচীর পরে কার্যদিবস শেষে কর্মকর্তা-কর্মচারী বিশেষ করে মহিলা কর্মকর্তা/কির্মচারীদেরকে ব্যাংকে অবস্থানের জন্য বাধ্য করা হচ্ছে। তাছাড়া, তফসিলী ব্যাংকের কর্মকর্তাগণের নিকট হতে চাকুরীতে ইস্তফা, অযৌক্তিক বরখাস্তকরণ কিংবা অপসারণ এবং পরবর্তী আর্থিক সুবিধা প্রাপ্তিতে হয়রানিসহ বিভিন্ন বিষয়ে অসংখ্য অভিযোগ উত্থাপিত হচ্ছে। ফলে বিভিন্ন রকমের জটিলতার উত্তব হচ্ছে বা সুষ্ঠু মানব সম্পদ ব্যবস্থাপনার ক্ষেত্রে অন্তরায়।
এতদসূত্রে ব্যাংক কর্তৃক পরিচালিত বিভিন্ন নিয়মাচার পর্যালোচনান্তে এ মর্মে সিদ্ধান্ত গৃহীত হয়েছে যে, ব্যাংকিং সময়সূচীর পরে অর্থাৎ সন্ধ্যা ৬.০০ ঘটিকায় কার্যদিবস শেষে ব্যাংকে অবস্থানের জন্য বাধ্য করা যাবে না। বিশেষ অফিসীয় প্রয়োজনে যদি কোন মহিলা কর্মকর্তা/কর্মচারীদেরকে ব্যাংকিং সময়সূচীর পরেও ব্যাংকে অবস্থান করতে হয় তবে তাদেরকে উপযুক্ত নিরাপত্তা ও পারিশ্রমিক প্রদান করতে হবে।
আরো উল্লেখ্য, ব্যাংক কর্তৃক ইচ্ছামাফিক ঢালাওভাবে কর্মকর্তা/কির্মচারী ছাটাই রদ করতে হবে। নিয়োগকালে পেশাদারিত্বের সাথে প্রার্থী যাচাই-বাছাই করতে হবে। নিয়োগকৃত কর্মকর্তা/কর্মচারীদেরকে প্রয়োজনীয় প্রশিক্ষণের মাধ্যমে উপযুক্ত করে গড়ে তুলতে হবে। এছাড়া, ব্যাংকের কর্মকর্তাগণের চাকুরীতে ইস্তফা, চাকুরী হতে বরখাস্তকরণ কিংবা অপসারণ এবং পরবর্তী আর্থিক সুবিধা প্রাপ্তির ক্ষেত্র International Labour Organazation Conventions, বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ ও সময়ে সময়ে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক প্রদত্ত নির্দেশনার যথাযথ প্রতিফলন ঘটিয়ে ব্যাংকের সার্ভিস রুলস সংশোধন করতঃ তার যথাযথ পরিপালন নিশ্চিত করতে হবে।
এ নির্দেশ অবিলম্বে কার্যকর হবে।"
14. This BRPD Circular Letter No. 07 dated 28th May, 2015, has been issued by the Bangladesh Bank in exercise of the powers vested in it, by clause (Ka) and (Gha) of sub-section (1) of section 45 of the Bank Company Act, 1991, that stipulates as follows:

"৪৫। ৩১) বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক যদি এই মর্মে সন্তুষ্ট হয় যে,
(ক) জনস্বার্থে, বা
(খ)
(গ)
(ঘ) কোন ব্যাংক-কোম্পানীর যথাযথ ব্যবস্থাপনার নিশ্চিত করার জন্য সাধারণভাবে সকল ব্যাংক-কোম্পানীকে, অথবা বিশেষ কোন ব্যাংক-কোম্পানীকে নির্দেশ প্রদান করার প্রয়োজন, তাহা হইলে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক যথাযথ নির্দেশ জারি করিতে পারিবে এবং সংশ্লিষ্ট- ব্যাংক-কোম্পানী উক্ত নির্দেশ পালান করিতে বাধ্য থাকিবে।"
15. Therefore, as per provisions of sub-section (1) of section 45 of the Bank Companies Act, 1991, the BRPD Circular No. 7 dated 28-5-2015 has the force of law and the directions given in it are mandatory and shall prevail over the Service Rules of all Banks. The Banks are legally bound to comply with all the directions given in this circular as well as to amend their Services, if so required, to bring them in conformity to these directions given by the Bangladesh Bank.

16. I have also taken into consideration that, the termination letter was issued before issuance of the circular. But, it does not permit an arbitrary action, nor would protect any colorable action of any kind. Here, the bank is the employer, while the plaintiff as well as all other employees and officials (executives and non-executives) all are employees of the bank. Hence, in all cases of termination, discharge, removal or dismissal it has to be proved that the action was taken bonafide and the interest of the Bank, which is substantially run by public money.

17. Every authority, whosoever, must exercise the powers vested in it to secure the end for which such power has been vested. No colorable exercise of power is sustainable in law. No power can be exercised without a guideline or on a pick and choose basis or in violation of legitimate expectation of a person aggrieved by exercise of such powers. The master and servant Rule, that served the interest of the capricious masters of the colonial era and had governed the private sector employment for decades, should now yield to the principles of fair play legitimate expectation and access to justice.

18. Inspite of all these facts, the paramount and consistently adopted principle is that, whoever is vested with any power is duty bound to exercise such power bonafide, fairly, and to further the causes for which such power has been vested. Each and every power is an entrustment. It cannot be exercised by anyone merely for the reason that such power is available in his or her hands. One, who exercises any power, must also prove that the exercise of such powers was not intended to settle any personal issue, nor tainted by any personal or other bias, not abrupt, not peculiar, nor based on pick and choose, not arbitrary. Onus to prove that such power has been exercised bonafide is on him who exercised the power. Any exercise of such power, in a public company, to victimize any person shall not be indulged by any court of law as in the case of the services under any public or statutory body.

19. The learned Advocate for the bank submits that, the plaintiff is a worker and he ought to have follow the procedure laid down in the Labour Act, 2006, before filing this suit, while he should have filed the case before the labour court. The learned Advocate for the plaintiff submits that, he is not a worker, rather he is an officer of the bank, since subsequently he has been promoted to the post of an officer. However, these are matter to be raised before and decided by the trial court.

20. Be that as it may, in view of the discussion made above, I am of the opinion that, the petition for rejection of plaint was not competent in this case and was rightly rejected by the trial court. Because, the petition for rejection of the plaint was based on the defence case and defence material, not on the averments made in the plaint. A petition for rejection of the plaint should be considered only with reference to averments made in the plaint. However, the trial court may frame, in an appropriate case, issue of law and decide the maintainability point as per provisions of Rule (2) of Order 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 1908.

21. The bank should issue release order in favour of the plaintiff in as much as it has asserted that this was a case of termination simpliciter.

22. In view of the discussion recorded above, this appeal and civil Rule should be disposed of.

Order
Accordingly, the FMA No. 33 of 2021 and the Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020 are disposed of. The trial court is directed to decide the maintainability point, as per Rule (2) of Order 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, immediately, if such an issue of law is pressed before it. Otherwise, it should dispose of this case within 60 (sixty) working days from the date of receipt of this judgment and order. The Bank is further directed to issue release order to the plaintiff within 30 (thirty) working days from the date of receipt of this judgment and order and to submit an affidavit of compliance. The order of stay granted earlier by this court is hereby vacated. In exercise of the power vested in this Court under Article 112 of the Constitution of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, the General-Manager, BRPD, Bangladesh Bank, is directed to examine or cause to examine the Service Rules of all Banks to ensure that the Banks have complied with the directions given in BRPD Circular No. 07 dated 28-5-2015, since it has the force of law as per clause (Ka) and (Gha) of sub-section (1) of section 45 of the Bank Company Act, 1991. They should submit a compliance report within next 90 (ninety) working days to this Court, through the Registrar of this Court. However, if so prayed for, this time limit may be extended by the court for just reason. This judgment shall not have any bearing on the merit of the case. The trial court shall decide the issues on merit and independently. Let copies of this judgment be sent to the Governor, Bangladesh Bank, to the Registrar of the High Court Division, Supreme Court of Bangladesh and to the General-Manager, BRPD, Bangladesh Bank, information and doing the needful. No order as to cost. Copies of this judgment also be sent to the courts below at once.

Judgment
Sheikh Hassan Arif, J:
Since the questions of law and facts involved in the aforesaid appeal and civil revision are almost same, and they have arisen from the same suit between the same parties, the same have been taken up together for hearing and are now being disposed of by this common judgment.

1.1 First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 178 of 2019 is directed, at the instance of the plaintiff in Title Suit 500 of 2018, against Order No. 08 dated 19-2-2019 passed by the First Court of Joint District Judge, Dhaka in the said suit thereby rejecting the application seeking temporary injunction filed by the plaintiff.

1.2 Rule in Civil Revision No. 52 of 2020 was issued, at the instance of the same plaintiff in the same suit, calling upon the opposite parties to show cause as to why the Order No. 17 dated 17-10-2019 passed by the said Court in the said suit, namely Title Suit No. 500 of 2018, thereby allowing an application filed by the defendant No.1 under sections 7 and 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 and thereby staying all further proceedings of the said Title Suit.
2. Background Facts:

2.1 Since the appellant and the petitioner in both the appeal and civil revision are same person, namely the plaintiff in the title suit concerned, we will refer him as plaintiff in this matter for the sake of convenience in our discussion.

2.2 Facts, relevant for the disposal of the appeal and Rule, in short, are that the appellant/petitioner, as plaintiff, filed the said Title Suit No. 500 of 2018 against the land owner and two developers seeking Specific Performance of Contract dated 10-4-2014 (Annexure-D in Civil Revision) between the plaintiff and the said two developers and land owner in respect of some flats and proportionate land as mentioned in schedule "Ka" and "Kha" to the plaint.

2.3 The case of the plaintiff, in short, is that the defendant No.1, being owner of 5 katha land as mentioned in 'Ka' schedule to the plaint, entered into a registered development agreement, being No. 8801 dated 28-7-2011, with defendant No.2 developer company (in short "Nagor Vision") to develop the said property. Accordingly, an irrevocable power of attorney giving extensive power was executed by the land owner (defendant No.1) on the same day in favour of the said developer (Nagar Vision). That during continuation of construction, since Nagor Vision fell into financial crisis, it entered into another development agreement with defendant No. 4-developer vide registered deed No. 9364 dated 13-10-2013 for development of the said property. Subsequently, when the defendant Nos. 1-5 could not continue with the construction/development work because of financial crisis, they executed a registered Baina with the plaintiff on 10-4-2014 for transfer of the developer's portion of the land and flats in favour of the plaintiff. That, as per the terms of the said Baina, the plaintiff paid the entire money, namely Taka 2,74,22,996.45. However, since the defendants were still unable to complete the development work, the plaintiff paid further amount of Taka 56,77,003.55 and, accordingly, the plaintiff paid in total Taka 3,31,00,000. That, in the meantime, the construction of the building has been completed and the land owner (defendant No.1) has got her portion of 50% flats as well as car parking spaces in possession and rented out some of them to the tenants. However, the defendants started delaying in giving registered kabala in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the remaining 50% of flats and lands and, accordingly, the plaintiff issued legal notice, but got no positive response. Thus, the plaintiff has filed the said suit seeking Specific Performance of the said Baina dated 10-4-2014.

2.4 Along with the said suit, the plaintiff filed an application under Order 39, rules 1 and 2 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking injunction for restraining the defendant Nos. 1 and 3 from evicting the tenants of the plaintiff in the suit property. The said application was objected by defendant Nos. 1 and 3 by filling written objection mainly contending that the baina in question had adopted the terms and conditions of the earlier development agreement between defendant Nos. 1 and 2 and, as such, by such adoption, the said baina incorporated the arbitration clause as mentioned in clause 17 of the said development agreement. This being so, it was contended by the said defendants by way of such written objection that the relief could not be sought in the way as had been sought by the plaintiff by filling the said suit, rather the plaintiff should have invoked arbitration clause as per Clause 17 of the said development agreement between defendant Nos. 1 and 2 as adopted in the baina in question.

2.5 Thereupon, the Court below, after hearing the parties, rejected the said application seeking temporary injunction vide impugned Order No. 8 dated 19-2-2019 on the ground that the baina in question in fact adopted and incorporated the arbitration clause as stipulated in Clause 17 of the earlier development agreement between defendant Nos. 1 and 2. Being aggrieved by this order of rejection, the plaintiff has preferred the aforesaid First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 178 of 2019. Upon admission of the said appeal and on an application filed by the plaintiff, this Court issued the connected Rule, being Civil Rule No. 272 (FM) of 2019, and, at the time of issuance of the Rule, vide an ad-interim order dated 3-4-2019, directed the parties to maintain status-quo in respect of possession and position of the suit property for a period of 06 (six) month, which was subsequently extended for further periods in due course.

2.6 Thereafter, the defendant No. 1 filed an application before the Court below under section 7 read with section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 seeking stay of the further proceedings of the said suit on the ground that the baina in question adopted an arbitration clause as incorporated in Clause-17 of the development agreement between defendant Nos. 1 and 2 and, as such, it was contended that the suit in question should be stayed allowing the parties to resolve their disputes through arbitration. The said application was opposed by the plaintiff by filling written objection mainly contending that the arbitration clause, as incorporated in Clause-17 of the said development agreement dated 28-7-2011, was only applicable to the parties to the said development agreement and that the parties to the baina in question could not be bound by such arbitration clause as incorporated in the said development agreement. It was further contended that although by Clause-12 of the baina agreement, terms and conditions of the earlier development agreement dated 28-7-2011 was adopted to the effect that the parties would be bound by the stipulations in the said agreement, such stipulation as incorporated in Clause-12 of the baina will only apply to the developers portion of the building and in no way will bind the parties to go for arbitration for resolving the dispute arising out of the said baina.

2.7 Thereupon, the Court below, after hearing the parties, allowed the said application filed by the defendant No.1 vide impugned order dated 17-10-2019 and thereby stayed all further proceedings of the said Title Suit No. 500 of 2018 by invoking section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001. Being aggrieved by this order, the plaintiff has invoked the revisional jurisdiction of this Court under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the aforesaid Rule in Civil Revision No. 52 of 2020. At the time of issuance of the Rule, this Court, vide ad-interim order dated 12-1-2020, stayed operation of the said impugned order dated 17-10-2019 for a period of 06(six) months, which was subsequently extended for further periods in due course.

2.8 The Appeal and Rule are opposed by defendant- respondent Nos. 1 and 3 (defendant-opposite party Nos. 1 and 3) through learned advocate Mr Md Monzur Alam Khan, who also filed an application for vacating the order of stay, which was kept with the record.
3. Submissions:

3.1 Mr Probir Neogi, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant and petitioner in both the matters, mainly submits that there are three agreements between the parties, namely that the first development agreement between defendant Nos. 1 and 2, the 2nd development agreement between defendant No. 2 and defendant No. 4 and the 3rd one is the baina in question between the defendants and the plaintiff. Therefore, according to him, although Clause-12 of the registered baina agreement dated 10-4-2014 has stipulated about the binding effect of the stipulations in the 1st development agreement dated 28-7-2011, such clause will only apply in respect of the developers' portion of the properties, namely 50% of the flats and land, and, as such, the arbitration clause, as incorporated in Clause 17 of the 1st development agreement dated 28-7-2011, will not be applicable in respect of the said baina. According to him, it is the cardinal principle of interpretation of any document that for interpretation of any clause therein the entire document has to be examined and considered and the said particular clause has to be interpreted as against the context of the entire agreement. Therefore, according to him, clause 12 of the baina dated 10-4-2014 read with Condition No.1 of the said deed makes it clear that the reference made in the said clause in respect of the conditions of the 1st development agreement will only be limited to the extent of share of the developer in the concerned property. In support of his such submissions, he has referred to different pages of the book authored by our late lamented constitutional lawyer Mr Mahmudul Islam, namely the book titled "Interpretation of Statutes and Documents", Mahmudul Islam, 1st Edition, pages 306-307 and 355-357. Accordingly, he submits that both the impugned orders being mainly based on the finding of the Court below that the subsequent baina dated 10-4-2014 has incorporated the arbitration clause as stipulated by Clause No. 17 of the first development agreement dated 28-7-2011, the same cannot stand in the eye of law.

3.2 As against above submissions, Mr Md Monzur Alam Khan, learned advocate appearing for the defendant-appellants (defendant-opposite parties), submits that Clause-12 of the baina in question has left no doubt about incorporation of the arbitration clause as incorporated in the development agreement dated 28-7-2011, particularly when the said baina was executed not only between the plaintiff and the subsequent developer, rather it was executed between the plaintiff and both the developers and the land owner. This being so, according to him, under no circumstances, the said Clause-12 of the baina in question can be interpreted in an isolated way thereby applying the same only to the developers' portion of the land particularly when the question of arbitrability of the dispute between the parties arises. According to him, although the baina has been executed by the parties in respect of developer's portion of the developed building and land, the said baina has specifically referred to the terms and conditions of the first development agreement between the defendant Nos. 1 and 2. Therefore, according to him, any dispute, as may arise from the said baina in question, has to be resolved by reference to two earlier development agreements between defendant No.1 and 2 and in between defendant No.2 and 4. This being so, he submits that under no circumstances the dispute arising from the said baina in question can be resolved without invoking the stipulations as incorporated in the said first development agreement dated 28-7-2011.
4. Deliberations, Findings and Orders of the Court:

4.1 To address the issues raised by the parties and to understand the issues whether the baina in question has in fact adopted the arbitration clause as stipulated by Clause 17 of the first development agreement, we have examined the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, 2001, in particular the definition of the term 'arbitration agreement' (1TA71) and the provisions under section 10 of the said Act. For our ready reference, both the provisions, namely section 2 (Dha) and section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 are reproduced below:

"২।(ঢ) "সালিস চুক্তি” অর্থ সুস্পষ্টভাবে বিধৃত চুক্তিগত বা ছুক্তিবহির্ভূত-ভাবে পারস্পরিক সম্মতিক্রমে আইনানুগ সম্পর্ক হইতে উদ্ভুত কিংবা উদ্ভুত হইতে পারে এইরুপ সকল বা যে কোন বিষয়ের রিরোধ সালিসের মাধ্যমে নিষ্পত্তি করার জন্য উক্ত আইনানুখ সর্ম্পকের পক্ষণণ কর্তৃক সালিসে প্রেরণ করা সম্পর্কিত চুক্তি;

১০। বিরোধের সালিসযোগ্যতা--(১) সালিস চুক্তির কোন পক্ষ বা উক্ত পক্ষের অধীন দাবীদার কোন ব্যক্তি সালিসের মাধ্যমে মীমাংসা হইবে মর্মে মতৈক্য হইয়াছে এমন কোন বিষয়ে চুক্তির অন্য কোন পক্ষ বা অনুরূপ পক্ষের অধীন দাবীদার কোন ব্যক্তির বিরুদ্ধে কোন আদালতে কোন আইনগত কার্যধারা রুজু করিলে, উক্ত কার্যধারায় লিখিত জবাব দাখিল করিবার পূর্বে যে কোন পক্ষ বিষয়টি সালিসে অর্পণ করিবার জন্য সংশিষ্ট আদালতে আবেদন করিতে পারিবে।
(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন আবেদনের প্রেক্ষিতে আদালতের নিকট বদি প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, সংশ্লিষ্ট সালিস চুক্তি বিদ্যমান আছে এবং উহা বাতিল, অকার্যকর বা সালিস দ্বারা নিষ্পত্তির অযোগ্য হয় নাই, তাহা হইলে আদালত বিষয়টি সালিসে প্রেরণ করিবে এবং উক্ত কার্যধারা স্থগিত করিবে।

(৩) উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন আবেদন আদালতের বিবেচনাধীন এবং আইনগত কার্যধারা বিচারাধীন থাকা সত্তেও সংশ্লিষ্ট বিষয়ে সালিস সূচনা করা, অব্যাহত রাখা এবং সালিসী রোয়েদাদ প্রদান করা যাইবে।"

4.2 It appears from the above quoted definition of the term "সালিস চুক্তি", as provided by the said Act, that it has referred to the relationship between the parties under the agreement or beyond the agreement. It has also referred to a future dispute which may arise between the parties within the terms of the agreement or beyond the terms of the said agreement. 

Therefore, it appears from the term "সালিস চুক্তি" that it has been defined by our Legislature in a very wide way thereby incorporating any dispute arising out of the relationship between the parties within the terms of the agreement and beyond the terms of the agreement. Same intention of the Legislature is apparent from the clear words as mentioned in the above quoted provisions under section 10 of the said Act. Two types of parties: to an arbitration agreement have been referred to therein, namely that the specific parties to such agreement or any party claiming under such parties to such agreement. Apart from above, Explanation to section 9 (2) of the said Act categorically recognizes such arbitration agreement by way of reference to a contract containing such arbitration Clause [see MR Engineers vs Som Datt Builders, 2009 (3) RAJ 448 (SC)]. These being the specific provisions of law without giving any space for interpretation by the Court by referring to any other external materials or text books, we are of the view that an arbitration clause in an agreement may be adopted by other parties who are claiming under the parties to the said agreement if the agreement in between such other parties adopts the said arbitration clause in the main agreement for resolving the dispute arising from the said subsequent agreement. We find support of this position of law in one case decided by the full bench of the Calcutta High Court in Dwarkadas Co. vs Daluram, AIR 1951 Calcutta-10.

4.3 With the above position of law, let us now examine the issues raised by the parties. Admittedly, the plaintiff in the suit concerned entered into the registered baina dated 10-4-2014 (Annexure-D to Civil Revision) as the First Party to the said contract. The Second parties to the said contract are Mrs. Amin Maria (land owner-defendant No.1), represented by the developer Nagor Vision Development Ltd. (defendant No. 2), and Nijhum Property Ltd., the subsequent developer (defendant No.4). Further admitted position is that the said agreement or baina was executed in respect of the developer's portion of the property, namely 50% of the property. Admittedly, defendant No.2 (Nagor Vision) and defendant No.4 (Nijhum properties) became parties to the said baina and executed the same mainly on the strength of the first development agreement, namely agreement dated 28-7-2011 (Annexure-D I to the Civil Revisional application). Therefore, it appears that the land owner (defendant No.1) entered into a development agreement with defendant No.2 in 2011 and, pursuant to the same, executed an irrevocable power of attorney giving extensive power in favour of defendant No. 2 for the development of the land and building thereon. Thereafter, on the strength of this agreement dated 28-7-2011 and the irreparable power of attorney executed on the same day, Nagor Vision (defendant No.2) entered into another development agreement with Nijhum properties (defendant No.4) for development of the said building because of its financial difficulties in continuing with the construction.

4.4 It now appears from the baina in question that because of the difficulties in continuing with such construction due to scarcity of funds, the said parties, namely the land owner (represented by Nagor Vision) and subsequent developer (Nijhum Properties) executed the said baina and thereby gave commitment to transfer 50% of the developed property (flats and proportionate land) in favour of the plaintiff. By virtue of Clause 12 of the baina in question, the parties to the baina agreed, amongst others, that the conditions in the first development agreement, namely agreement dated 28-7-2011, would be binding on them. Clause 12 of the said baina is reproduced below:

"১২। বিগত ২৫-৫-১১ ইং তারিখে সম্পাদিত রেজিস্টিকৃত ব্যাপক ক্ষমতা সম্পন্ন একই আমমোক্তার নামা দলিল যাহার দলিল নং ৮৮০২ এবং একই তারিখে সম্পাদিত ভূমির মালিক ও ডেভলপার এর মধ্যে রেজিঃকৃত চুক্তিনামা দলিল যাহার দলিল নং ৮৮০১ এ অনুযায়ী এর তপসিল সম্পত্তি কিংবা ডেভোলপমেন্ট এর সমুদয় হিস্য। অত্র ১ম পক্ষের বরাবর হস্তান্তর হইবে এবং উক্ত দলিলের সকল শর্ত মানিতে বাধ্য থাকিব।"

4.5 Admittedly, the first development agreement dated 28-5-2011 has an arbitration clause under Clause 17. The exact Clause 17 of the said development agreement is also reproduced below for our ready reference:

"১৭। অত্র চুক্তিপত্র ল্মায় পক্ষদ্ধয়ের মধ্যে চুক্তি বিষয়ে কোন বিরোধ সৃষ্টি হইলে উক্ত বিরোধ নিষ্পত্তির জন্য ১ম ও ২য় পক্ষ উভয়ের সন্মতিক্রমে তিনজন সালিসকারক নিয়োগ করা হইবে। আরবিট্রেশন এ্যাক্ট-২০০১ এর বিধান্মতে উক্ত সালিসকারকের রায় বা পরামর্শ সকল পক্ষ মানিয়া চলিতে বাধ্য থাকিবেন।"

4.6 Therefore, the question arose in the aforesaid appeal and Civil Revision is as to whether this Clause 17 of the first development agreement should be regarded as one of the clauses or conditions of the baina in question. As stated above, subsequent development agreement with Nijhum properties and the baina in question were executed by defendant Nos. 1-5 basically on the strength of the said first development agreement dated 28-7-2011 between the land owner and Nagor Vision. This basis of every subsequent transaction is further reflected from the context of the baina in question. Admittedly, the second party in the said baina are the said land owner and subsequent developers (Nagor Vision and Nijhum Properties) and they jointly agreed to transfer the developer's portion of the properties, namely 50% of the developed properties, in favour of the plaintiff, and the suit in question has been filed for enforcement of the said registered baina.

4.7 Therefore, under no circumstances, the said registered baina can be examined in an isolated way. In other words, the said baina, or the terms of the said baina, cannot be examined with its entirety ignoring the terms of the said original development agreement dated 28-7-2011 and the power of attorney executed thereon. Different terms of the said baina in question also acknowledge such correlation. The said baina has also made specific reference in respect of the said development agreement between the land owner and Nagor Vision. Therefore, if the said baina categorically stipulates that the terms of the said development agreement, namely development agreement dated 28-7-2011, will be binding on the parties to the said baina, it cannot be said that the arbitration clause incorporated in the development agreement is not incorporated or adopted by the parties in the said baina. It cannot be denied that the parties to the said baina, before execution of the same, have themselves read the terms and conditions of the said development agreement dated 28-7-2011 including Clause 17 therein, and upon realizing the terms and conditions thereof, they have agreed to execute the said baina incorporating Clause 12 therein stipulating that the parties to the said baina would be bound by the terms and conditions of the said development agreement dated 28-7-2011.

4.8 Therefore, as stated above the parties to the said baina are now claiming to enforce their rights, or opposing such enforcement, under the parties of the said development agreement. Although the plaintiff was not a party to the said development agreement, by executing baina in question with Clause 12 therein, he has agreed to be bound by the terms of the said development agreement including Clause 17 thereof. Therefore, as per the definition of the 'arbitration agreement', as provided by section 2 (Dha) of the Arbitration Act 2001, the said baina should be termed as an agreement which arose from the said development agreement dated 28-7-2011 incorporating an arbitration clause therein under Clause 17. Thus, it cannot be denied that this baina dated 10-4-2014 also contains an arbitration agreement.

4.9 This being the position, it cannot also be denied that the parties claiming or opposing their rights and title under the said baina are doing so under the parties to the arbitration agreement. Accordingly, the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, 2001, in particular section 10 of the same, may be invoked in case of any proceeding initiated by any of such parties before any Court in Bangladesh. In this regard, we have examined relevant parts of the book authored by Mr Mahmudul Islam, namely the book titled "Interpretation of Statutes and Documents". However, the contents of those parts are not relevant in the facts and circumstances of this case.

4.10 In view of above, since in the suit concerned the defendant No.1, who is admittedly a party to the said development agreement dated 28-7-2011 and the baina in question, has the right to file an application before the Court seeking stay of further proceedings of the said suit by referring to the arbitration clause, or arbitration agreement, between the parties, the Court below has committed no illegality in rejecting the application filed by the plaintiff seeking temporary injunction as well as in staying the further proceedings of the suit concerned by invoking section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001. Thus, we do not find any merit in both the aforesaid appeal and Rule. Accordingly, both of them should fail.

4.11 In the result, the appeal is dismissed. Connected Rule, namely Civil Rule No. 272 (FM) of 2019, is also disposed of. Ad-interim order, if any, thus stands recalled and vacated. Rule issued in Civil Revision No. 52 of 2020 is also discharged. Ad-interim order, if any, passed therein stands recalled and vacated. Communicate this.

High Court Division

Present:
Mr. Justice Md. Badruzzaman (Dist.-Mymensingh)

Civil Revision No. 2757 of 2021.

Nurul Kabir......Petitioner
VS
Sodaha Ludhi Shikdarpara Jame Masjid and others .......... Opposite Parties

Counsels:
.......... Opposite Parties Judgement Date : November 09, 2022

Tushar Kanti Roy, Advocate—For the Petitioner. Md Faysal Hasan Arif, Advocate with Mahuz Bin Yousuf, Advocate—For Opposite Party No. 1.

Judgment
This Rule was issued calling upon opposite party No.1 to show cause as to why judgment and order dated 13-1-2021 passed by learned Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Chattogram in Civil Revision No. 156 of 2019 affirming an order dated 6-1-2019 passed by learned Senior Assistant Judge, Satkania, Chattogram in Other Suit No. 262 of 2016 rejecting an application under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of plaint should not be set-aside.

2. At the time of issuance of Rule, this Court vide ad-interim order dated 6-12-2021 stayed further proceeding of Other Suit No. 262 of 2016 for a period of 6(six) months.

3. Facts, relevant for the purpose of disposal of this Rule, are that opposite party No.1 as plaintiff instituted Other Suit No. 262 of 2016 against the present petitioner and others in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Satkania, Chattogram praying for a decree of declaration of title to 0.40 acre suit land and another declaration that BS Khatian Nos. 1398, 1399 and 2895 in respect of the suit land were wrongly prepared and published in the name of Md Kamal Uddin and his mother Obeda Khatun instead of the plaintiff, declaration of heba deed executed by Md Kamal Uddin in favour of defendant Nos. 3-7 dated 4-8-2009 being No. 1817 and the Mutation Khatian No. 3949 are illegal, void, without jurisdiction and for such misdeeds the title and possession of the plaintiff to the suit land have not been affected in any way.

4. Defendant No. 6 entered appearance in the suit and then filed an application under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of plaint against which the plaintiff filed written objection. The trial Court, upon hearing of both parties, vide order dated 6-1-2019 rejected the application fixing the next date for filing written statement.

5. Being aggrieved by said order dated 6-1-2019 defendant No. 6 preferred Civil Revision No. 156 of 2019 before the learned District Judge, Chattogram which was transferred to learned Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Chattogram for disposal who, upon hearing both parties, disallowed the revision vide judgment and order dated 13-1-2021 by affirming the order passed by the trial Court.

6. Being aggrieved by said order dated 13-1-2021, defendant No. 6 has preferred this application under section 115(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the Rule and order of stay, as stated above.

7. Plaintiff-opposite party No.1 has entered appearance by filing vokalatnama to contest the Rule.

8. Mr Tushar Kanti Roy, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner by taking me to the plaint, application for rejection of plaint and the orders passed by the Courts below submits that the suit is barred by the principle of res judicata and also barred under section 6A and 102 of the Waqfs Ordinance, 1962 inasmuch as that in view of provisions under section 6A(4) of the Waqfs Ordinance, 1962 the Administrator of Waqfs is empowered to take steps for correction of record-of-rights and the plaintiff, who is a stranger to the waqf estate, has no locus standi to institute the suit and as per the provisions under section 102 of the Ordinance 'Civil Court' has no jurisdiction to decide title in respect of waqf property and accordingly, the plaint should have been rejected by the trial Court. Learned Advocate submits that the revisional Court without considering the relevant provisions of law illegally disallowed the revision by affirming the order of the trial Court and, as such, committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice and accordingly, interference is called for by this Court.

9. As against the above submissions, Mr Faysal Hasan Arif, learned Advocate appearing for opposite party No.1 submits that the question of locus standi as well as res-judicata are mixed questions of law and fact which cannot be decided in disposing of an application under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure and these issues can only be decided only upon taking evidence during trial. Learned Advocate further submits that admittedly, the suit property is waqf property but the previous mutawalli recorded the waqf property in his name along with his mother in the RS Khatians instead of the name of waqf estate and thereafter, transferred the same without any permission from the Administrator to defendant Nos. 3-7 by way of declaration of heba deed and since the previous mutawalli and his son, the present mutawalli, did not protect the interest of the Waqf, the plaintiff filed the present suit for protection of the waqf property. By referring to the provisions under section 2(8) of the Waqfs Ordinance, learned Advocate submits that 'person interested in a waqf' includes a beneficiary and any person who has a right to worship or to perform any religious rite in a mosque, idgah, imambarah, dargah, maqbara or other religious institution etc, may file a suit to protect the waqf property when the mutawalli goes against the interest of the waqf estate.

10. Learned Advocate further submits that though section 6A of 'The Waqfs Ordinance' conferred power upon the Administrator of Waqfs to take immediate steps for correction of record-of-rights which has not recorded in the name of the waqf estate but, in the instant case, the Administrator did not take any steps to correct the record-of-rights. Learned Advocate further submits that in the instant suit not only the record-of-rights has been challenged but also the deed of declaration of heba which has been executed by the previous mutawalli transferring the waqf property to his relatives and mutation khatian have been challenged, the Administrator has no jurisdiction to decide whether the said deed or record-of rights were legal or whether by said deed the defendants have acquired any right, title and interest to the suit land by way of said declaration of heba deed and accordingly, the suit is not barred by law.

11. Learned Advocate finally submits that the provisions under section 102 of the Waqfs Ordinance provides that no decision or order of the Administrator can be questioned in any suit or other proceeding in Court except as otherwise expressly provided in the Ordinance but in the instant case, decision or order of the Administrator has not been challenged and accordingly, the revisional Court committed no illegality in refusing to reject the plaint by affirming the order of the trial Court and, as such, interference is not call for by this Court.

12. I have heard the learned Advocates, perused the plaint, application filed under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the orders passed by the Courts below as well as relevant provisions of law to come to a proper decision.

13. On perusal of the plaint, it appears that the suit has been filed by "ছদাহা লধুী সিকদার পাড়া জামে মসজিদ" represented by the Vice-President of the Committee of the mosque. In the averment of the plaint, the plaintiff stated that 0.40 acre suit land is waqf property out of which 0.30 acre was dedicated by Begumjan and others vide registered deed of waqf dated 17-6-1954 being No. 4345 in favour of the plaintiff mosque and handed over possession thereof in its favour and by said deed Danu Miah was appointed as first mutawalli. Thereafter, Syed Ahmed Mohuri transferred 0.10 acre suit land to the plaintiff vide waqf deed dated 23-11-61 being No.5677 and Md Kamal Hossain, the predecessor of defendant Nos.3-7, was appointed as mutawalli of the waqf estate and in his tenure he recorded said 0.40 acre suit land in his name along with his mother instead of the name of the waqf estate i.e. the plaintiff and thereafter, said mutawalli transferred the suit land in favour of his children (defendant Nos.3-7) by registered declaration of heba deed being No. 1817 dated 4-8-2009. It has also stated in the plaint that the defendants are now claiming title to the waqf property as their personal property and, as such, the waqf estate filed the suit represented by the Vice-president of the mosque Committee praying for a decree of declarations, as stated above.

14. As per averments of the plaint, the father of defendant No. 6, who was previous mutawalli recorded the waqf property in his name along with his mother instead of the name of waqf estate and also transferred the suit land by declaration of heba deed dated 4-8-2009 to defendant Nos. 3-7. This averment of the plaint is not denied by defendant No. 6 who is also claiming that he is the present mutawalli of the waqf estate.

15. Under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure the plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:

(a) Where it does not disclose a cause of action,
(b) Where the relief claimed is undervalued and the plaintiff, on required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so,
(c) Where the relief claimed is properly valued but the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so,
(d) Where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law, Provided that the time fixed by the Court for the correction of the valuation or supplying of the requisite stamp-paper shall not exceed twenty-one days.

16. It is not the case of the defendant that the plaint does not disclose cause of action or the relief claimed is undervalued or the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped and the plaintiff failed to supply requisite stamp-paper as per direction of the Court. The defendant has sought for rejection of the plaint mainly on the ground that the suit is barred by law in that the plaintiff has no locus standi to file the suit and the suit is barred by the principle of res judicata and under sections 6A (4) and 102 of the Waqfs Ordinance, 1962.

17. It is settled principle of law that question of res-judicata is a mixed question of law and fact which cannot be decided upon an application filed under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure but the same can only be decided at the time of trial upon taking evidence. On the face of it, the suit has filed by the waqf estate and the plaint has signed by Janu Mia claiming to be empowered by the mosque Committee representing the waqf estate for protection of the interest of the waqf. On the other hand, defendant No.6, Nurul Kabir is claiming to be the present mutawalli of the waqf estate and he is legally authorized to represent the waqf estate. But both parties are admitting that the suit property is waqf property belonging to the mosque. Though defendant No. 6 is claiming himself as mutawalli but he did not come forward to file the suit for protection of the interest of the waqf estate.

18. Now question arises whether the waqf estate itself can file a suit for protection of its own interest and if answer is positive, who will represent the waqf estate?

19. Sub-section (1) of section 6A of the Waqf Ordinance, 1962 provides that 'any immovable property belonging to any waqf estate shall be recorded in the record-of-rights in the name of the waqf and shall be represented by the designation of mutawalli, Receiver or Administrator, as the case may be.'

20. Sub-section (4) of section 6A of the Ordinance also provides that 'if any immovable property belonging to any waqf estate is not recorded in accordance with the provisions of this section, the Administrator shall take immediate steps for correction of the record- of-rights.

21. In the instant case, admittedly, the record-of-rights of the suit property was not recorded in the name of waqf estate but the same has been recorded in the name of previous mutawalli and his mother. Accordingly, the Administrator of Waqfs should have taken immediate steps for correction of record-of rights under sub-section (4) of section 6A of the Waqfs Ordinance. By filing supplementary affidavit learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the Administrator of Waqfs.by order dated 30-3-2015 (Annexure-C-1) directed the petitioner (mutawalli) to take steps for correction of record-of-rights in the name of waqf estate. But, it appears that the petitioner (defendant No. 6) for unknown reasons, did not take any steps in view of the order passed by the Administrator of Waqfs dated 30-3-2015 as yet.

22. Section 56 (1) of the Waqfs Ordinance makes a clear bar of transfer of waqf property by way of sale, gift, mortgage or exchange by the mutawalli without the previous sanction of the Administrator. Sub- section (4) of section 56 also provides that 'where a mutawalli transfers a waqf property in contravention of sub-section (1) and afterwards himself becomes the owner of the property, the mutawalli shall, on the direction of the Administrator, reconvey the property to the waqf. Sub-section (5) of section 56 also provides that 'any transfer made in contravention of the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be an act of malfeasance and breach of trust for the purpose of sub-section (1) of section 32. Section 32 of the Ordinance provides provision of removal of mutawalli on the allegation of breach of trust, mismanagement, malfeasance or of any act of the mutawalli causing loss of the waqf property.

23. It appears that the previous mutawalli transferred the waqf property in favour of his children (defendant Nos. 3-6) which has been challenged in the suit. Admittedly, no unction was obtained before the transfer of the suit property by the previous mutawalli. As per section 56(3) of the Ordinance, such transfer shall be declared void, if the Administrator applies to the Civil Court in this behalf. No such action has been taken by the Administrator nor he proceeded against the previous mutawalli under section 32 of the Ordinance. On the other hand, though the Administrator vide order dated 30-3-2015 directed defendant No.6 to take steps to prepare record-of-rights in the name of the waqf estate but he did not comply with the said order and the Administrator did not take any action against
defendant No.6 for non-compliance of his order dated 30-3-2015.

24. Procedure as to when the Administrator may institute a suit or proceeding in his own name in a Court to protect the interest of a waqf property has been provided in section 83 of the Ordinance which reads as follows:

"83. If there is no mutawalli or the mutawalli refuses or neglects to act in the matter, within a reasonable time, the Administrator may, in his own name, institute a suit or proceeding in a Court against a stranger to the waqf or any other person-(a) for the establishment of right, title and interest in a waqf property, or
(b) for confirmation of possession in a waqf property, or
(c) for the recovery of any waqf property wrongfully possessed, alienated or leased, or (d) ................
(e) .............
(f) For any other relief in the interest of a waqf he may consider necessary."

25. The provisions under section 83 clearly suggest that in the event of refusal or negligence on the part of the mutawalli in the matter, the Administrator of Waqfs is empower to institute a suit or proceeding in a Court in his own name against a stranger to the waqf or any other person to protect the right, title and interest of a waqf property. In other words, the Administrator has no authority to pass a decree against such person like a civil Court declaring right, title and interest of a waqf property, or confirmation of possession of a waqf property, or of recovery of possession of any waqf property wrongfully possessed, alienated or leased.

26. The Waqfs Ordinance, 1962 has defined `a person interested in the waqf,' in section 2(8) as follows:
"person interested in a waqf' includes a beneficiary and any person who has a right to worship or to perform any religious rite in a mosque, idgah, imambarah, dargah, maqbara etc or other religious institution and establishment connected with the waqf or to participate in any religious or charitable institutions under the waqf.

27. There is no provision in the Waqfs Ordinance, 1962 prohibiting 'a person interested in the waqf,' as defined in section 2(8) of the Ordinance, or 'the waqf estate itself,' as the case may be, to establish the right, title and interest of the waqf by filing a suit or proceeding in a Court in the event of failure on the part of the Administrator of Waqfs or mutrawalli in taking necessary steps under sections 6A, 56 or 83 of the Ordinance to protect the interest of the waqf.

28. Accordingly, I am of the view that, being a person interested in the waqf, the vice-president of the mosque committee has locus standi to institute the suit representing the waqf estate for protection of its interest.

29. On the other hand, section 102 of the Waqfs Ordinance provides that except as otherwise expressly provided in this Ordinance, no decision or order of Administrator shall be questioned in any suit or other proceeding in any Court'. In the instant case, it appears that, the plaintiff did not challenge any such order or decision of the Administrator.

30. In that view of the matter and given the facts and circumstances of the present case, the present suit is not barred under any provision of the Waqfs Ordinance. Accordingly, the plaint cannot be rejected on the ground that the suit is barred by law. As such, the Court of revision committed no illegality in dismissing the revision by affirming the order of the trial Court, rejecting the application for rejection of the plaint.

31. In that view of the matter I find no merit in this Rule.

32. In the result, the Rule is discharged, however without any order as to costs. 33. The order of stay granted earlier is hereby vacated.
The trial Court is directed to proceed with the suit and conclude the trial expeditiously.

First Appeal No. 151 of 2006.


Alauddin and others --------- Appellants
VS
Narayan Chandra Shil being dead his heirs: 1(a) Keshob Chandra Shil and others --------- Respondents

Judgement Date : October 31, 2022 

ABM Siddiqur Rahman Khan with Md Rafiqul Islam Faruque, Advocates—For the Appellant. ABM Matiur Rahman with Nahid Sultana, Advocates—For Respondent No. 1.

Judgment

Md Ali Reza, J:

This appeal at the instance of defendants 6 and 7 is directed against the judgment and decree dated 2-5-2006 passed by the District Judge, Narayanganj in Title Suit No. 02 of 1988 arising out of Probate Case No. 12 of 1984.

2. Respondent No. 1 Sree Narayan Chandra Shil (since dead) as petitioner filed Probate Case No. 12 of 1984 in the Court of District Judge, Narayanganj on 25-11-1984 for granting probate of the will dated 14- 8-1943. The probate Case was subsequently transferred to the Court of Subordinate Judge, Narayanganj and renumbered as Probate Case No. 75 of 1985. The appellants namely Alauddin and Amina Begum being 3rd party to the will filed an application on 3-1-1987 for their addition as opposite party and they were added as opposite parties 6 and 7 on 8-2-1987. Opposite party 6 then filed written objection on 28- 5-1988. Later on, the case was transmitted to the Court of District Judge who considering the written objection converted the probate case to Title Suit No. 2 of 1988 by order 41.

3. The case of the petitioner-plaintiff-respondent is that the suit land belonged to Shoshi Mohon Shil who had 5(five) sons named Jagadish, Robindra, Brindabon, Khetra Mohon and Shadhon. Jagadish, Robindra and Brindabon left this country for India in 1940 and lived there permanently. Khetra Mohon lived separately in Tongi. The youngest son Shadhon was taken in adoption in his childhood by his aunt through ritual participated by his brother Shoshi Mohon Shil and accordingly Shadhon was grown up there with and by his aunt. Subsequently, Shadhon being inspired to the ideals of Islam embraced the same and changed his name to Mohammad Shahjahan and started living in the address in Dakshin Khan, Uttara. Thus, Shoshi Mohon Shil being abandoned by his family started living in the house of his eldest brother Nagorbashi. Nagorbashi at his own cost took proper care of Shoshi with maintenance and medication and Shoshi was satisfied with that. Shoshi desired to make a will in favour of Nagorbashi and expressed such intention to the local respectable persons and consequently executed the same on 14-8-1943 in presence of witnesses. Previously no will had been executed by Shoshi. Nagorbashi or his successors were empowered to take probate. Shoshi himself read the contents of the will and signed the same with full understanding in presence of the witnesses and scribe. The petitioner filed the case for granting probate with the original copy of the will.

4. The Court kept the will in the safe custody by order 2 dated 29-11-1984.

5. The case of opposite party-defendant-appellant No. 1 as made out in written objection is that the three sons of Shoshi Mohon named Jagadish, Rabindra, Brindabon went to India permanently before 1947 and another son Khatro Mohon predeceased his father. Shashi Mohon died in 1959 leaving behind his youngest son Shadhon as his only successor. Shadhon became owner in possession. He was neither
adopted to his aunt nor lost his title in his paternal property. Shoshi never executed the will and the same is forged, fraudulent, illegal and inoperative. Nagarbashi or his heirs did not acquire any right, title and interest in the suit property. Shadhon while maintaining title and possession in the suit land was inspired by the ideals of great Islamic religion and accepted the same on 17-7-1967 when he was about 22 years old. Subsequently, due to necessity of money he sold the suit land to Alauddin and his wife Amena on 03-10- 1983 by 03(three) registered kabalas and delivered possession. Alauddin and Amena are opposite parties 6 and 7 respectively. Earlier the plaintiff-respondent filed Title Suit No. 194 of 1983 which was dismissed on 27-6-1985. The petitioner has no title and possession in the suit land. The suit is liable to be dismissed.

6. The Court of District Judge framed as many as 5(five) issues as to maintainability, limitation, whether the will filed by the plaintiff is genuine or not, whether the plaintiff has right and possession in the suit land and whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree as prayed for.

7. In course of trial plaintiff examined 3(three) witnesses and filed the will which was marked as Exhibit 1. On the other hand, the defendant 6 examined 03(three) witnesses but he did not file any document.

8. The Court of District Judge upon hearing the parties and perusal of evidence held that the plaintiff petitioner has been able to prove the case and he is entitled to have the order of probate and accordingly the suit was decreed on 2-5-2006.

9. The defendant-opposite parties 6 and 7 being aggrieved by the impugned judgment preferred the instant appeal.

10. Mr ABM Siddiqur Rahman Khan with Mr Md Rafiqul Islam Faruque, learned Advocates appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted that the impugned judgment is bad in law and liable to be set-aside. Mr Khan submitted that the lower Court erred in law in granting probate although according to section 63 of the Succession Act read with section 68 of the Evidence Act, two attesting witnesses are required to be examined but the plaintiff-petitioner did not take any such step in the instant case. The plaintiff also did not prove the testamentary capacity of Shoshi Mohon to the effect that at the time of execution he was in a sound and disposing state of mind and he understood the nature and effect of such disposition and put his signature on his own free will. He further submitted that the learned District Judge did not consider that the appellants being purchasers from Shadhon alias Shahjahan constructed house in the suit land thus respondent cannot claim on the basis of will which is forged and fraudulent. He laid much emphasis on suspicious circumstance and submitted that the instant probate case was filed long after 40 years from the date of execution of the alleged will in 1943. The case of the plaintiff on the alleged adoption is also not proved in evidence and the will also does not have any such recital in its body. He further submitted that Title Suit No. 194 of 1983 filed at the instance of the plaintiff-respondent for declaration of title against the same party since was dismissed the petitioner is not entitled to any remedy. The will since being surrounded by suspicious circumstance the same cannot be considered the testamentary disposition of the testator. In support of his submission he has referred the case of Biswaswar Das Karmakar and others vs Sasanka Mohan Das and others reported in 35 DLR (AD) 315, Khitindra Chandra vs Jalada Devi 35 DLR (AD) 102, Paresh Chandra vs Hiralal Nath and others 36 DLR (AD) 156, Jogendra Nath vs Amulya Chandra and others 44 DLR (AD) 147, Narendra Nath vs Sunil Kumar 1994 BLD (HCD) 10 -= 45 DLR 567, Janki Narayan vs Narayan Namdeo (2003) 2 SCC 91, Rur Singh vs Bachan Kaur (2009) 11 SCC 1, Kanchan Bala vs Gita Rani 14 BLC 472, Bhagirat Barman vs Haricharan 4 BLC (AD) 234, Oom Prokash vs Shoroshoti Bai AIR 1998 MP 226 and Thirty Sam Shroff vs Shiraz Byramji AIR 2007 Bom 103. He finally submitted that the petitioner did not even mention the time of death and amount of asset of the testator and the case is also barred under section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

11. Mr ABM Motiar Rahman, learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-respondent submitted that the appellant cannot challenge the grant of probate under section 283(1)(c) of the Succession Act. The appeal is not maintainable because the appellants are not aggrieved as defined under the law and the revocation case is not maintainable and they have no locus standi to challenge the probate Case. The three kabalas dated 3-10-1983 include fictitious land and those are invalid documents under section 28 of the Registration Act. Moreover, the appellant did not even file and prove those documents in evidence. He finally submitted that the respondent is entitled to get the aid of section 90 of the Evidence Act in the given facts and circumstances of the present case and the impugned judgment calls for no interference by this Court being passed upon proper appreciation of evidence. He has referred the case of Sree Moti Charu Bala Sen vs Abul Hashem and others reported in 33 DLR (AD) 254 and ADC (Revenue) vs Orun Kumar 6 BLC 354.

12. We have heard the learned Advocates for both sides and perused the evidence on record and gone through the impugned judgment and the grounds taken in appeal.

13. It is admitted that Shoshi Mohon had 05(five) sons named Jagadish, Rabindra, Brindabon, Kethromohon and shadhon alias Shahjahan, Jagadish, Rabindra, Brindabon permanently left this country for India before 1947. Khetro Mohon lived separately in Tongi and died during the life time of his father. The plaintiff-respondent claims that Shadhon was adopted to his maternal aunt. Subsequently, he embraced Islam on 17-7-1967 and named himself as Shajahan through affidavit dated 27-7-1967 in which he asserted that he was about 22 years old at that time. Thus it appears that admittedly he was born in 1945 after two years of the execution of will dated 14-8-1943 (Exhibit 1). So, it can be safely held that he had no personal knowledge about the will or its execution. Defendant 6 now appellant denied the case of adoption raised by respondent. Respondent Narayan is the son of propounder Nagarbashi who is the brother of testator Shoshi. The son of Shoshi named Shadhon alias Shahjahan is said to have sold the suit land to the appellant by 3(three) documents dated 3-10-1983. Appellant 2 is the wife of appellant 1 but she did not file any caveat or contest the suit. Defendant 6 did not even file their documents. Defendants 6-7 in order to contest the probate case filed application for their addition on 3-1-1987. The then Subordinate Judge allowed the application on 8-2-1987 only on the finding that they had good reason to be added as party to the litigation. It is absolutely surprising how the Subordinate Judge found good reason without any document and beyond the settled law. However, the respondent did not go to the Higher Court against such order. But in the instant appeal this Court is not fettered to examine whether the order dated 8-2-1987 was rightly passed or not. The main question is whether the appellant got any interest in the estate of the testator so as to be called upon to come and see the proceeding before the grant of probate as provided under section 283 of the Succession Act. In order to entitle a person to come and see the proceeding before the grant of probate he must show that he is interested in the estate of the deceased. Here the purchaser-appellant did not even produce their documents in evidence. Moreover, in the evidence it appears that both DW 1 and DW 2 claimed to be transferee and transferor respectively to those documents clearly admitted that those documents were registered in Tongi Sub registry office instead Rupganj and the vendor had no paper to show any land belonging to him in Tongi. Law is settled that document holding fictitious property is invalid under section 28 of the Registration Act. So the appellant have simply failed to show that they have any interest in the estate of the testator.

14. The interest in the estate of the testator within the words of section 283 of Succession Act means an interest through the testator. A person who claims outside or independently of the will or claims adversely to the testator and disputes his right to deal with the property cannot be deemed to claim any interest in the estate of the deceased. The crucial point in this case is whether the appellant claimed any interest in the estate through the testator and since they do not and cannot do so they had no locus standi to be added as a party or question the execution or attestation of the will in this probate proceeding. This aspect of the case has long ago been settled in Charu Bala case reported in 33 DLR (AD) 254. This Charu Bala case was affirmed in the case of Shubra Nandi Mojumder vs Begum Mahmuda Khatun reported in 42 DLR (AD) 133. In Shubra Nandi's case, caveator Mahmuda claimed interest through an agreement executed by the testator Sharat Kumar himself and filed application for her addition in the probate proceeding. Consequently, Leave was granted and our Honorable Appellate Division referring to Charubala case held that the point has been settled and there is no scope for taking different view. A
Division Bench of this Court also relied upon the same principle in the case reported in 6 BLC 354.

15. It appears that in all cases referred to by the appellant the caveator happens to be claiming through testator as heir or reversioner but in the instant case the appellants claimed independently. So the main submission of the appellant on technicality of suspicious circumstance relying upon those referred cases bears no value and falls through. In the event of contesting the case by Shahjahan himself may arise the question of suspicious circumstance or whether Shoshi was competent or in a sound and disposing state of mind or possessed testamentary capacity at the time of execution of Exhibit 1 dated 14-8-1943. In fact, admittedly Shahjahan was born in 1945 and he had no knowledge whether Nagarbashi resorted to any fraud, undue influence and coercion in course of execution by testator Shoshi. Moreover, paragraph 15 (xiv) of T Romesh case (online version) referred to by the appellants shows that such allegations on fraud etcetera brought about by the caveator with regard to execution have to be proved by him.

16. Shadhon alias Shahjahan is sealed with a case of adoption. PW-1 Narayan is the paternal cousin of Shahjahan and PW-2 Rabindra is the brother of Shahjahan. They deposed on adoption. PW 2 is the significant witness because as an heir he was entitled to the property left by his deceased father if he would have opposed the will. He is the disinterested witness. He supported the case of adoption. On the other hand, DW-1 Alauddin admitted in evidence that Shadhon lived in the disputed house with his father but Shadhon alias Shahjahan as DW-2 himself admitted that his uncle Banabashi maintained him and in 1967 he lived in Manikdi Tejgaon and his present address is Dakshin Khan, Uttara. DW 3 also supported that Banabashi maintained Shadhon. The possession of Shadhon alias Shahjahan is material in the instant case in order to defeat the case of adoption. Shahjahan as well as the appellant has to make out a definite case that before sale to the appellants in 1983 Shahjahan lived in his paternal house. But admittedly things are different here. Even the affidavit dated 27-7-1967 shows his address was Balughat, Cantonment, Tejgaon in 1967. Therefore it is held that the earlier possession of vendor Shahjahan in the suit land is not proved in evidence.

17. The will was executed in 1943. The appellant claimed to have purchased the land in 1983 from Shajahan. PW 3 stated in evidence that the appellant tried to enter into the suit land after purchase from Shajahan for which criminal case was started and he was convicted. He further stated that he has home in a portion of the land. There is no specific evidence on the entry of the appellant in the suit land. As discussed above, Shajahan's possession was not proved. In this context it is understood that after purchase in 1983 appellant forcibly had entered into a portion of the suit land. Since Shajahan had no possession, the appellant's possession, if any, claiming under Shajahan is not believable. But it transpires that he is a trespasser and law is settled that a trespasser cannot maintain his illegal possession against the real owner.

18. Learned Advocate for the respondent submitted that the will was executed in 1943 and it was a very old event so it was not possible to prove it by direct evidence. The will was produced from the proper custody without objection. So there is a presumption under section 90 of the Evidence Act that the will was duly executed and attested. Learned Advocate for the appellant strongly opposed this argument. He drived our attention to paragraph 14(b)(i), 14(e)(ix) of T Romesh Case and submitted that presumption under section 90 does not apply to will because wills have to be proved in terms of section 63(c) of the Succession Act read with section 68 of the Evidence Act.

19. To understand the intention and purpose of a law all the relevant sections of that particular law must be read together. From a combined reading of sections 283(1)(c) and 63(c) of the Succession Act, it appears that the party who wants to assail a will relying on section 63(c) must at first satisfy the requirement of section 283(1)(c) that the attacking party-caveator coming under section 284 must be a party claiming interest in the estate through testator and if such party claims independently of the will cannot be said to have interest in the probate case. In the instant case the appellant claims independently and he even did not produce his documents before the Court and the documents also are said to have been tainted with fictitious property. In such a situation the appellant-caveator cannot get the benefit and question the validity of the will under section 63 where he has no legal right or interest under section 283 of the Succession Act. The ratio of the case of Kanchan Bala reported in 14 BLC 472 as referred to is similarly not applicable in the present case because in that case Kanchan Bala was claiming not independently but through testator according to section 283 of the Succession Act.

20. In the case of Md Abdul Motin Kazi vs Govt. of Bangladesh reported in 11 ADC 133 interpretation of law on section 90 of the Evidence Act has been laid down. In the instant case there is no evidence to show that Nagarbashi ever played any unscrupulous role in course of execution of the will (Exhibit-1). Rather the appellant-caveator being a third party to the will did not even bother to produce their documents challenging the will. His conduct appears to be unscrupulous. Exhibit-1 came from proper custody and was more than 30(thirty) years old and on its face it is presumed that the same was executed by Shashi Mohon in a sound disposing state of mind. Relaying on the authority of the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Munna Lal vs Mst. Kashi Bai AIR (34) 1947 PC 15 the presumption in cases of execution and attestation of will under section 90 of the Evidence Act was drawn by a Division Bench in the case of Mst. Saran vs Abdul Rashid reported in PLD 1950 Sind 131. In the case of Swarna Kottoyya vs Karancheti Vardhamma reported in AIR 1930 Mad 744, the similiar view was taken long ago.

21. Considering the fact and circumstance of the present case it appears that a presumption, therefore, arises under section 90 of the Evidence Act that Exhibit-1 evidencing the will is a genuine document and validity executed.

22. It has been stated in paragraph 3 of the application (now plaint) of the probate case that the plaintiff respondent is empowered to take the probate after the death of propounder Nagarbashi. Clause 5 of the will (Exhibit-1) also shows the same and, as such, the respondent has become the propounder under section 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure read with sections 268 and 295 of the Succession Act. Respondent as PW 1 stated in evidence that his father could not file the probate case during his life time for his illness. Learned Advocate for the appellant strongly submitted that this long delay in filing the probate case would raise suspicion and he referred the judgment of Patna High Court passed in the online case of Hari Nath Thakur vs Sri Bhagwan Thakur. In the referred case the objection was also filed by the persons claiming through testator. The fact of the case is also different from the instant case. It transpires that after purchase in 1983 this appellant has been causing disturbance in the peaceful possession of the respondent who was at peace before such transfer. But according to the line of events he was forced to file this case because his back was against the wall. Minorities are under pressure in every country's social system. Many times they are deprived of basic rights and legal facilities. Respondent did not file this case until he was compelled to do the same after being threatened and subsequent illegal trespass of the appellant in around 1987. Without the guarantee of fundamental human rights and the rule of law no nation can attain perfection. Justice is established when the idea that what is injurious to others is injurious to oneself comes to the mind of the people of the society. When there is inequality in the society, people move away from the concept of morality and treat the weak with injustice. It disrupts social behavior and state principles. This kind of injustice can be removed from the society through well thought out and specific application of law. The technicalities of the law should be used sparingly with caution keeping in mind that justice shall not come undone. In the instant case, it is sad to experience that appellant pleads with the technicality of suspicious circumstance without producing any document. This Court is reluctant to accept such submission.

23. Appellant did not file and prove any paper of Title Suit No. 194 of 1983 and the matter in issue of that suit as alleged is apparently not the same. Question of res judicata does not arise at all. As discussed above appellants have no interest in the estate through testator under section 283 of the Succession Act and their access to this proceeding is shut down. For the reasons stated above we are not inclined to interfere with the judgment and decree passed by the District Judge and accordingly this appeal having no merit is dismissed.
Communicate this judgment to the concerned Court. Send down the lower Court's record.

End.
