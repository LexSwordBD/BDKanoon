Judgment
Naima Haider, J:

1. This application filed by Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust/BLAST in the nature of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to ensure the fundamental rights of equality between women and men. The petitioners felt aggrieved by the continued inclusion of a provision in the prescribed marriage registration forms (kabinnamah) (BG Form Nos. 1600 and 1601), which perpetuates discrimination between women and men, and also by the failure to require photographs of the parties to be submitted when registering marriages. Under Muslim law as applicable in Bangladesh, marriages are required to be registered in the prescribed form (the Kabinnamah) pursuant to section 3 and 5 of The Muslim Marriages and Divorce (Registration) Act, 1974 ["The 1974 Act"] read with Rule 28(1)(a) of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Rules, 1974 ["The 1974 Rules"]. The rules have been further amended in 2009.

2. The distressing matter of fact is that after conclusion of the registration procedure of marriage by the parties, Form No. 1600 is kept with the Kazi's office and Form No. 1601 is provided to the parties. Both forms at clause No. 5 require the bride to make a statement as to her marital status and her sexual history, specifically stating whether she is unmarried or virgin/ widowed/divorced. In contrast, the forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/divorced /previously married or is a virgin.

3. Such a clause targeting the women in particular and which is so discriminating and arbitrary that it has created inequality between bride and groom as only the bride is required to provide her personal information regarding marital status, sexual history etc. which is being robustly violative of fundamental rights, in particular the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sex, the right to be treated in accordance with law, as guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution. Interference with such privacy also violates a women's right to personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 31 and 32 of the constitution.

4. Inclusion of the Word "Kumari" instead of "Unmarried" is humiliating and degrading the women's personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 32of the constitution and contradicts with Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) inasmuch as it has the effect of discrimination against women on the basis of sex, also impairing the dignity of woman by invading upon their privacy. This Court issued Rule in the following terms:

"Why the entry No. 5 in Forms No. 1600 and 1601 should not be declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect being discriminatory against women on the ground of sex and marital status in violation of Articles 28, 31 and 32 of the Constitution, and as to why the respondents should not be directed to take necessary action:

(i) to amend the Bangladesh Forms No. 1600 and 1601 (kabinnama), by omitting the use of the word "Kumari" in respect of brides, and,
(ii) to ensure that information regarding marital status (never married/ married but divorced/marriage subsisting/) is required in respect of both men and women without any discrimination, and
(iii) to impose a mandatory requirement for both the bride and groom to affix their respective photos to these forms, and
iv) to produce National ID Card at the time of registration of marriage."
5. Mr ZI Khan Panna, the learned senior advocate appearing for the Petitioner with learned advocate Ms. Aynunnahar Siddiqua submits that the writ petition has been filed bona fide in the public interest to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to ensure the fundamental rights of equality between women and men, the impugned inclusion of a provision in the prescribed marriage registration forms (kabin-namah) (BG Form Nos. 1600 and 1601), which perpetuates discrimination between women and men, and also by the failure to require photographs of the parties to be submitted when registering marriages. He further submits that after conclusion of the registration procedure of marriage by the parties, Form No. 1600 is kept with the Kazi's office and Form No. 1601 is provided to the parties, both forms at clause No. 5 require the bride to make a statement as to her marital status and her sexual history, specifically stating whether she is unmarried or virgin/ widowed/divorced, in contrast, the forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/divorced/ previously married or is a virgin.

6. Learned advocate for the Petitioner vehemently submits that the impugned requirement is so discriminating and arbitrary that it has created inequality between bride and groom as only the bride is required to provide her personal information regarding marital status, sexual history etc. which is being robustly violative of fundamental rights, in particular the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sex, the right to be treated in accordance with law, as guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution and interference with such privacy also violates a women's right to personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 31 and 32 of the constitution.

7. Mr Amit Talukder, the learned Deputy Attorney-General entered appearance by filing affidavit-in opposition on behalf of the respondent No. 1.

8. The case of the respondent No. 1 is that the Rule 10 of the Muslim Family Law Rules, 1961 as framed under the Muslim Family Ordinance, 1961 provided a prescribed form No. II wherein at serial No.5 the words virgin/ maiden/widow or divorced were inserted. Thereafter, under Rule (1) (Ka) of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Rules, 2009 has formed under the Muslim Marriage and Divorce (Registration) Act, 1974 provided a prescribed form as Form-Gha wherein at Serial No.5, the similar words were inserted as virgin/ maiden/widow or divorced lawfully.

9. Mr Amit Talukder, the learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 1 submits that prescribed Forms for registering marriage (kabin-Nama) has been inserted under the provision of Rules 27(1)(Ka) in the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Rules, 2009 which has no intention to hurt the privacy of women.

10. Mr Ishrat Hasan, the learned Advocate entered appearance by filing affidavit in opposition on behalf of the respondent No. 5.

11. The case of the respondent No. 5 is that the right to freedom of religion is an important right of the citizens of every modern state and article 41(1)(a) of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh protects the citizen's fundamental right freely to profess, practice, and propagate religion. The protection given to this right is not absolute. It is subject to law, public order and morality as article 41(1) itself denotes. The freedom enunciated in this article 41 is a personal freedom. It is a freedom which a person can claim for his personal exercise at will. The freedom guaranteed in this article is the right of any person to entertain such religious views as appeal to his individual conscience without interference by any person or power, civil or ecclesiastical, is as fundamental in a free state as is the right life and liberty. Religion, in this article, includes all form of belief in the existence of superior beings exercising power over human beings by violation, and imposing rules of conduct, with regards in the present life as well as with future rewards and punishments in life hereinafter. The religion under the constitution need not be theistic. Citizens irrespective of their religious beliefs are entitled to the right envisaged in this article. All shall enjoy equal constitutional guarantee. Among religions our constitution adopted Islam as the state religion of the Republic at the same time ensuring equal status and equal right in the practice of the Hindu, Buddhist, Christain and other religions. Whereas, religion of a person is his own belief, contention of inequity cannot be applied here.

12. Mr ishrat Hasan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No.5 submits that the petitioner alleges this term "Kumari" is humiliating, unreasonable and degrading and at the same time violative of fundamental rights protected by articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution. The respondent No.5 disagrees with this contention. In Bangladesh sexual intercourse between an adult man and adult women is not offence. So, if any women had sexual intercourse before marriage and give birth to a child remaining unmarried later marriages someone hiding existence of her child and then the consequences would be adverse. The man to whom she is married will put her to a grave dispute regarding the parentage of child and she may face the litigation of fraud. Another consequence is that if she is one month or two months pregnant at the time of marriage and after her marriage according to section 112 of the Evidence Act, 1872 the husband will be the father of the child. Then question DNA test will arise and ultimately litigation.

13. In the midst of the bearing, this Court felt it necessary to invite one/more advocates to assist this Court on the issues of Islamic family laws and jurisprudence, one of the learned advocates of the Bar, namely, Mr M Belayet Hossain voluntarily came forward and expressed his intention to act as an intervener in this matter. Accordingly, we have allowed him to assist this Court.

14. The intervener learned advocate Mr M Belayet Hossain submits that the issues involved in this Rule touch the Constitutional regime of equality, privacy and freedom of religion. He submits that this Court should, in disposing of the Rule, examine the essentials of a valid Muslim marriage, legal and shareeah characteristics of an Islamic wedlock. He has categorically submitted that the essentials of a muslim marriage are that there should be a proposal, made by or on behalf of the parties to the marriage, and acceptance of the proposal by or on behalf of the other, in the presence of two witnesses who must be sane adult Muslims, at one meeting, although traditional Islamic family law does not require a marriage to be registered, the 1961 Ordinance, 1974 Act, 1975 Rules and 2009 Rules require a muslim marriage to be compulsorily registerable, failure to register a marriage has been made an offence, the solemnization of marriage if validly effected might not be affected for non-registration of the marriage, but the non registration of the marriage causes a doubt on the solemnization of the marriage itself, although marriage may be presumed from prolonged and continued cohabitation as was held in ALM Abdullah vs Rokeya Khatoon reported in 21 DLR 213. He further draws our attention to the decision reported in 8 ADC (2011) 855 (Momtaz Begum vs Anowar Hossain) wherein the Appellate Division observed that marriage among Muslims is not a sacrament but purely a civil contract, marriage brings about a relationship based on and arising from a permanent contract for intercourse and procreation of children between a man and a woman. A marriage contract, as a civil institution, rests on the same footing as other contracts. Though generally solemnized with recitation form the Qur'an, no specific ceremonies or religious rites are necessary for contracting a valid marriage, nor is evidence in writing required. Thus, deletion of the impugned word or re-phrasing the same in a more sensible way will not in any way affect the personal laws of the Muslim citizens inasmuch no religious script made the impugned disclosure in public a requirement for validity of a marriage, rather the principles of Islamic jurisprudence do not sanction publicity of one's sexual history or disclosure of such a private issue in a public document, he submits.

15. Mr M. Belayet Hossain argues that the submission made on behalf of the added respondent to the extent that 'the word—kumari-should be there to determine the issue of consent in a marriage as a girl who has not experienced sexual cohabitation in the past must not be married to a man without her consent' is misconceived inasmuch the conduct of a girl of a tender age in wedlock is observed by her wakil/guardian and the witnesses to the ceremony who are required to put their signatures in the impugned kabinnama on being satisfied that the essential ingredients of the marriage have been satisfied, and the other clauses of the impugned kabinnama e.g. clauses 7, 8, 11, 19 are sufficient to deal with the issue of consent of the girl, the kazis appointed for the purpose of registration of Muslim marriages are required to follow the legal and shariah principles in respect of the conditions and warranties to be satisfied in a wedlock and generally they explain the same before the parities/their agents or wakils/guardians. Thus making a provision for mandatory disclosure of a fact vis-a-vis sexual experience/in experience of a girl is a superfluous act. Moreover, since the impugned term takes different meanings at different places should be deleted from such a public document that carries solemnity, sanctity and religious fabrics. He submits —'obviously The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 [Act No. XXVI of 1973] made provision for the application of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) to Muslims in Bangladesh, and by the Laws Continuance Enforcement Order, 1971 all laws that were in force in Pakistan, continued to be in force in Bangladesh (this provision was substituted by Article 149 of the 1972 Constitution), therefore, Bangladesh inherited all personal laws along with the citizens' personal laws, but no personal law sanctions mandatory disclosure of a sexual history in a written document or in a marriage session/ceremony, rather Islam discourages disclosure of a very private issue to members of the public', therefore, the deletion of the term—kumari—from the impugned kabinnama will not affect any provision of the personal laws of Muslims.

16. He finally submits, additionally, that in a society where hundreds of child marriages (with or without taking consent from girls) are taking place despite there being strict application of the restraining laws, where forced sexual intercourse/ rape etc. takes place at urban and rural areas, forcing a girl to disclose her sexual history in that circumstance in a duly solemnized marriage ceremony (on repudiation of the previous marriage in cases of forced/child marriage or in a wedlock of a rape victim) is out and out a degrading treatment towards her and that attracts the Constitutional provisions of right to privacy, right to be treated equally and in accordance with law, moreover, public policy or social morality prohibits such an arrangement in a formal written declaration.

17. We have considered the submissions advanced by the learned advocates, perused the petition, affidavits-in-opposition, application for addition of party, provisions of the relevant laws, judgments and the extracts taken from the books written by the scholars in the relevant fields.

18. This Court is of the view that since the issue of Muslim marriage is primarily guided by the personal laws of the Muslim citizens of the Republic and since the 1937 Act recognized the personal laws (Shariat) of Muslims as laws of the land and since the framers of the 1972 Constitution did guarantee the right to practice and propagate religions in the Republic, it should not examine the constitutional legitimacy of the impugned entry made into the Kabinnama without considering the legal and jurisprudential aspects of Islamic/muslim marriage (in Arabic Nikah) in the instant context. Thus, we will be examining the constitutional, legal and Islamic jurisprudential aspects of the issues in question, additionally, we will take international obligation vis-à-vis the non-discriminatory treatment towards women into consideration in disposing of the Rule.

Issues for determination by this Court

19. In the above premises, we will deal with the following:

a) Whether the impugned entry is violative of the equality right of the women of the Republic or whether such an insertion has affected the non-discriminatory character of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh ;

b) Whether deletion/rephrasing of the impugned entry will in anyway infringe violate any marriage to be entered into by muslim male and female under Mohamedan Law.

Pathology of the impugned entry:

20. The relevant part of the impugned kabinnama is inserted below:

21. The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (Ordinance No. VIII of 1961) promulgated to give effect to certain recommendations of the then Commission on Marriage and Family Laws ["the 1961 Ordinance"] in its section 5 made a provision for registration of marriages which was omitted by section 15 of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974 (Act No. LII of 1974) ["the 1974 Act"]. Pursuant to the promulgation of the 1961 Ordinance, the Muslim Family Laws Rules, 1961 were framed ["the 1961 Rules"]. Form -II appended to the said Rules was called Nikah-Nama that contained in clause (5) the following : ........ (5) Whether the bride is a maiden , a widow or a divorcee Translated in Bangla as (৫) কনে কুমারী, বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা

And for the bridegroom, there was no such provision, although in clause (21) it required "Whether the bride-groom has any existing wile..."

22. Subsequently, on 24th July, 1974, the 1974 Act came into being, pursuant to which on 1st July, 1975, the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Rules, 1975 ["the 1975 Rules"] were framed by the then Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Form E[nikahnama in Bangla] appended to the 1975 Rules contains a clause namely clause 5 that runs as follows:

"(৫) কনে কুমারী, বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা"
23. In contrast, the forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/divorced /previously married or is a virgin.

24. The Government vide SRO No. 201-Ain/2009 framed new Rules namely মুসলিম বিবাহ ও তালাক (নিবন্ধন) বিধিমালা, ২০০৯ ["the 2009 Rules"] by virtue of section 14 of the 1974 Act repealing the earlier rules/1975 Rules. Although the previous rules had been repealed, the form suggested therein contains the similar clause. Form Gha appended to the 2009 Rules reads, amongst the others, the following :

"(৫) কনে কুমারী, বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা ?..............
২১। বরের কোন স্ত্রী বর্তমানে আছে কি না এবং থাকিলে অন্য বিবাহে আবদ্ধ হইবার জন্য বর ১৯৬১ সালের মুসলিম পারিবারিক আইন অধ্যাদেশ মোতাবেক সালিসী কাউন্সিলের অনুমতি লইয়াছে কি না?...........
২২। অন্য বিবাহে আবদ্ধ হইবার জন্য সালিসী কাউন্সিলের নিকট হইতে বরের নিকট প্রেরিত অনুমতি পত্রের নম্বর ও তারিখ..........."
25. Although Muslim marriages and divorces are compulsorily registerable under laws now in force in Bangladesh, Hindu marriages have not been made compulsorily registerable as such under the newly enacted laws namely হিন্দু বিবাহ নিবন্ধন আইন, ২০১২ came into force on 27th January, 2013 and হিন্দু বিবাহ নিবন্ধন বিধিমালা, ২০১৩ came into force on 27th January, 2013. Clause 6 of the Form Gha appended to the Rules 2013 reads :

"৬। কন্যা কুমারী অথবা বিধবা কিনা?.........."
26. Now we should look into the dictionary meaning of the word - কুমারী. Bengali — English Dictionary, published by the Bangla Academy, June , 1994 defines the word at page 133 as under:

.n. 1. an unmarried girl of marriageable age, a virgin, a maiden. 2. Woman who remains single after the conventional age of marrying, a spinster, 3. A daughter : state of being a virgin; virginity...'

27. Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 7th Edition, 2005, Oxford University Press defines the word 'virgin' as: 'a person who has never had sex', and defines 'spinster' as " ..(old fashioned, often disappointing) a woman who is not married , especially an older woman who is not likely to many [this word should not now be used to mean simply a woman who is not married.. "

History of Bangladesh in respect of Registration of Muslim Marriages in this Region :

28. We have perused the relevant pages of Muslim Law in India and abroad authored by Dr. Tahir Mahmood (one of the most celebrated legal scholars in this sub-continent), he has summed up the history [at pages 53-65] of legislation in the field of muslim marriage and divorce in this region in a precise manner and style. Dr Mahmood writes

‘......... A Kazis Bill was introduced in the central legislature in 1879 with a long Statement of Objects and Reasons explaining why the government's power to appoint official kazis had been withdrawn, what problems its action had created, and why it was being resumed, the Kazi, in this country; before the advent of British rule, appears to have performed certain other duties, partly of a secular and partly of a religious nature. The principal function of these Kazis seems to have been preparing, attesting and registering deeds of transfer of property, celebrating marriages, and performing other rites and ceremonies. It is not apparent that any of these duties were incumbent on the Kazi as such. It is probable that the customary performance of them by him arose rather from his being a public functionary and one known by his official position to be acquainted with the law, than form his having, as Kazi, a greater claim to perform them than anyone else.

Such was the position of the Kazi in this country under Native Government. On the introduction of the British rule, Judges and Magistrates took the place of Kazis, and the Kazi in his judicial capacity disappeared. But the British Government, though no longer recognizing the judicial functions of the Kazi did not abolish the office. By certain Regulations passed from time to time the appointment of Kazi-ul Kuzat and Kazis by the State was provided for and the performance of their non-judicial duties was recognized by law.’

29. We note from the submission made by Mr M Belayet Hossain that currently there are Muslim Marriages and Divorce Registration Acts in force in six States of India for voluntary registration of marriages and divorces among the local Muslims. The States are: West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Orissa and Meghalaya. The parent Law among these is the old Bengal Mohammedan Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1876 which is now in force in the first three of the names States. The Orissa legislature re-enacted in 1949, with some changes, the old Bengal law of 1876 titles The Orissa Mohammedan Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1949 it extends to the whole State. The Assam legislature had enacted a similar law in 1935 titled: The Assam Moslem Marriage and Divorce Registration Act.

30. The 1876 Act made elaborate provisions for voluntary registration of marriages and divorces with the so-called Mohammedan Registrars, laid down their powers and function, and provided forms for registration by them. It empowered the provincial governments to make rules to provide other details for carrying out the purposes of the Act, which were soon issued. The Act was of an administrative nature and clarified the nature of its provisions in the following words:

Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed to:

(a) render invalid merely by reason of its not having been registered any Mohammedan marriage or divorce which could otherwise be valid;

(b) render valid by reason of its having been registered any Mohammedan marriage or divorce which could otherwise be invalid;

31. The most important provision of the Act was the one requiring the Mohammedan Registrars to periodically transmit their records to the District Registrars. The system was to be helpful in maintaining official records of marriages among the Muslims. The provision was borrowed mutatis mutandis, from the Christian Marriage Act 1872.

32. Unlike the Bengal Act of 1876, The Kazis Act does not provide any form for certification of marriages by the kazis. The kazis, both official and private, do keep forms of nikahnama [marriage agreement] but there is no uniform or standard form used for this purpose everywhere. The basic things mentioned in every nikahnama are names, age, parentage and address of parties and the amount and nature of dower. The document is signed by the parties or their vakils [guardians or their nominees] and gawahs [witnesses]. and authenticated by the kazi. The documents carry great weight as proof of marriage. Evidence of the kazis preparing nikahnama and the witnesses signing them is considered to be satisfactory proof of marriage.

33. The UN Convention for Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women promulgated in 1979 required all state parties to introduce measures for compulsory registration of marriages. The Indian government ratified the Convention but with some reservations in that matter. From 2006 onward the Supreme Court of India [without mentioning the government's reservation on the CEDAW provision] repeatedly issued directions that registration of all marriages among all communities should be made compulsory throughout India. Seema vs Ashwini kumar, AIR 2006 SC 1158.

34. Pre-Independence and Post-Independence positions in Bangladesh: Muslim Family Laws Ordinance: The Bengal, Bihar and Orissa Mohammedan Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1876 had remained in force in East Pakistan after the partition of India. No such law existed in any of the provinces of British India which as a result of partition of India in 1947 had become West Pakistan, and now constitute the whole of Pakistan. Only the central Kazis Act was extended to some places Under the Muslim family Laws ordinance promulgated by the federal government in Pakistan in 1961, and made applicable to both West and East Pakistan, section 5 provided for compulsory registration of all marriages in the country. Non registration would be punishable offence but will not affect the validity of marriage. After the creation of Bangladesh as a new State in 1972 the Ordinance remained in force there.

35. New Bangladesh Act: In 1973 Bangladesh amended the old Mohammedan Marriages and Divorces Registration of 1876, and next year replaced it with a new Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act 1974. The new Act repealed section 5 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961 [relating to registration of marriages] in its application in Bangladesh. Statutory rules under the new Act were framed in 1975 and amended on several occasions as we have seen above. Currently the 2009 Rules are in force.

36. Although the said States of the Union of India made several provisions for voluntary registration of muslim marriages, enactment of such law was halted in Jammu and Kashmir. THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR MUSLIM MARRIAGES REGISTRATIONACT, 1981 (Act No. XXII of 1981) was enacted in 1981 providing for compulsory registration, but had to be soon withdrawn due to stiff opposition by community leaders. Dr. Mahmood observes:

There is a feeling in Muslim religious circles that compulsory registration of a religious marriage would have the effect of converting it into a civil marriage no more to be governed by the personal law, due to which they have not been in favour of it. Their understanding of the matter is absolutely incorrect and they need to be properly educated about it. Whatever be the position of registration of marriages, voluntary or compulsory, it is merely an administrative process having nothing to do with any substantive aspect of marriage. Registration does not change a religious marriage into a civil marriage and even after registration it continues to be governed by the personal law of the parties.

37. It appears the SCHEDULE prescribed by the Act [under sections 2(a) and 3]. Contents to be maintained in a nikah registration form :

1. Place of marriage (with sufficient particulars to locate the Place.) 2. (a) Full name of the bride-groom. (b) His age. (c) His place of residence. (d) Address. (e) Full name of bridegroom's father. (f) Whether father is alive or dead. (g) Civil condition of the bridegroom at the time of marriage whether—Un-married, Widower Divorced Married, and if so, how many wives are alive. (h) Signature or thumb impression of the bridegroom/ Vakil/Guardian according as the Nikah was performed in person by the bridegroom or through his Vakil or Guardian. 3. (a) Full name of the bride. (b) Her age. (c) Her place of residence. (d) Address. (e) Full name of the bride's father. (f) Whether father is alive or dead. (g) Civil condition of the bride at the time of marriage whether—Un-married Widow Divorced. (h) Signature or thumb impression of the bride/Vakil/Guardian according as the Nikah was performed in person by the bride or through her Vakil or Guardian.

38. We may now have a look at the relevant parts of the Form used in registration of Muslim marriages in West Bengal. For ready reference the same is quoted below :

Schedule to the 1876 Act Muslims
(See sections 6 and 11)
Form A
Book I
Register of Marriages (as prescribed by section 6 of the Act for the voluntary registration of Mohammadan Marriages and Divorces).
4. Whether the bride is a spinster, a widow or divorced by a former husband and whether she is adult or otherwise.
5. [Name of the guardian of the bride-groom (if the bride-groom be a minor) and that of the guardian's father, with specification of the guardian's residence, and of the relationship in which he stands to the bride-groom.]
6. [Name of the guardian of the bride (if she be a minor) and that of his father, with specification of his residence, and the relationship in which he stands to the bride.]

39. The form used in West Bengal for registration of Muslim marriages uses the word -'spinster' in place of kumari, considering the definition given by the Oxford Dictionary (quoted above) it may be reasonably concluded that both `virgin' and 'spinster' are equally degrading.

Constitutional aspects and international obligations in respect of gender equality: is the impugned entry to the kabinnama violative of the Constitutional and international obligations?

40. Ours is a Constitutional democracy where constitutionalism and rule of law prevail. In its preamble, and in Part II and III, the Constitution clearly spelt out the type of society that was the dream of the framers and the leaders of the independence movement. The preamble declared that it shall be a fundamental aim of the State to realise through the democratic process a socialist society, free from exploitation a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens.

41. Article 7 says, "The Constitution is the Supreme law of the Republic and if any law is inconsistent with the Constitution, the other law, shall to the extent of the inconsistency, be void." Article 11 provides that the Republic shall be a democracy in which fundamental human rights and freedoms and respect for the dignity and worth of human person shall be guaranteed. Further, our Constitution in Article 27 in clear and unambiguous terms provides that All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. Article 26 reads: All existing law inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, become void on the commencement of this Constitution.

42. Constitution not only guarantees equality of all citizens irrespective of sex, religion etc, but also provides for special arrangements for the backward classes. Article 28 provides: (1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only on religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth: (2) Women shall have equal rights with men in all spheres of the State and of public life; (3) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth be subjected to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to access to any place of public entertainment or resort, or admission to any educational institution. (4) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making special provision in favour of women or children or for the advancement of any backward section of citizens.

43. Article 31 guarantees treatment in accordance with law, right to PRIVACY etc. It reads:

“....... To enjoy the protection of the law, and to be treated in accordance with law, and only in accordance with law, is the inalienable right of every citizen , wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time being within Bangladesh, and in particular no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law ..........”
44. Now we should be looking into the international obligations of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh vis-à-vis gender equality, equal protection of law, non-discriminatory treatment towards women members of the Republic. Bangladesh ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1984 and has submitted seven progress reports on its implementation and participated in meetings of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (herein after the Committee).

45. The Eighth Periodic Report of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Submitted Under Article 18 in 2015 contains, inter cilia:

‘....... 34. In addition to legal measures to maintain equality, equal protection of law; and non discrimination, institutions and measures are in place as follows:

35. National Council for Women and Children Development (NCWCD): National Council for Women Development (NCWD), chaired by the Honorable Prime Minister and consisting of representatives of government, civil society, and women's organizations was merged in 2009 with the National Council for Child Development (NCCD) and was named the National Council for Women and Children Development (NCWCD). The NCWCD provides policy guidance and monitors the implementation of critical policy decisions on women's and children's development.

36. Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MOWCA): MOWCA is the nodal ministry for gender governance and acts as the lead ministry in promoting gender equality. MOWCA coordinates the response by all government agencies to the needs and priorities of women and implements policies and programme& through its three agencies, Department of Women Affairs (DWA), Jatiya Mohila Shangstha (JMS) and Bangladesh Shishu Academy (BSA). A Policy Leadership and Advocacy Unit (PLAU) provides technical support to MOWCA in coordinating women's advancement activities within the Government. The Annex D shows the existing institutional mechanism.

37. Other mechanisms: Other institutional mechanisms such as Parliamentary Standing Committee for MOWCA and Women In Development Focal Point (WIDFP), WIDFP Implementation and Evaluation Committee (WIDFPIEC), Women In Development Focal Point Coordination Committee (WIDFPCC) and Women In Development Focal Point Network Committee (WIDFPNC) are in place. The WIDFPs of all ministries lead to address gender concerns within the policies and plans of their respective ministries.

38. Development Plans: Equality is promoted through implementation of development plans. The Perspective Plan (2010-2021) provides framework for the implementation of the Government's Vision 2021....”

46. In that premises, we are of the view that the Government is pledge bound to and under an obligation to protect the rights of women and to ensure gender equality in all spheres of the Republic.

47. The content and ambit of the great equalising principle enunciated in article 27 is wide. There can be no doubt that it is a founding faith of the Constitution, our apex Court in several decisions have held that it is the pillar on which rests securely the foundation of our democratic Republic. It was held in Shayara Bano vs Union of India reported in (2017) 9 SCC 1 that Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits.

48. We coincide with what was pointed out by the majority in EP Royappa vs State of TN reported in (1974) 4 SCC 3:

‘........... From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14....'

49. Nariman, J holds in Shayara Banos case Article 14 (our article 27) strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article 14. It must be "right and just and fair" and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive; otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied."

50. We are of the view that the fundamental right to equality guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution, manifested within its fold equality of status. Gender equality, gender equity and gender justice are values intrinsically entwined in the guarantee of equality under the Constitutional realm, the rights of a Muslim women to human dignity, social esteem and self-worth are vital facets of a woman's right to life with dignity, under Articles 27, 28, 31 and 32 of the Constitution. It was submitted that gender justice was a constitutional goal of overwhelming importance and magnitude, without accomplishing the same, half of the country's citizenry, would not able to enjoy to the fullest—their rights, status and opportunities. That gender equality and the dignity of women are non-negotiable, they are necessary not only to realise the aspirations of every individual woman, who is an equal citizen of this country, but also, for the larger well-being of society and the progress of the nation, one-half of which is made up by women. The basic structure permeates equality of status and opportunity. Personal laws are derived not from the Constitution but from the religious scriptures. Human rights and fundamental freedom have been reiterated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and have mutual reinforcement. It was held in the Triple Talaq Case (mentioned above): the human rights for women, including girl child are, therefore, inalienable, integral and 'indivisible part of universal human rights. The full development of personality and fundamental freedoms and equal participation by women in political, social, economic and cultural life are concomitants for national development, social and family stability and growth, culturally, socially and economically. All forms of discrimination on grounds of gender is violative of fundamental freedoms and human rights." We take the view that Articles 26, 27, 28, 31 are inseparable part of the basic structure of the Constitution. These values the right to equality, non-discrimination and the right to live life with dignity forms (he bedrock of the Constitution. Furthermore, gender equality and dignity for women is an inalienable and inseparable part of the basic structure of the Constitution, the most fundamental facet of equality under the Constitution was gender equality and gender equity. Thus we do not find any difficulty in striking out the impugned entry from the impugned kabinnama.

51. The next issue we like to deal with is PRIVACY. Although the word has not been used in our Constitution as it is, it is implied in the words and phrases of Articles 11 and 32 as dignity, reputation and privacy are part and parcel of right to life. It was held in Govind vs State, reported in AIR 1975 SC 1378:

‘.......... The right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through a process of cast by case development. Therefore, even assuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and freedom of speech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation from them which one can characterize as a fundamental right we do not think that the right is absolute a right to privacy is itself a fundamental right...'

52. Similarly in Mr 'X' vs Hospital 'Z', reported in AIR 1999 SC 495, it was held:‘......... Right of privacy may apart from contract, also arise out of a particular specific relationship which may be commercial, matrimonial, or even political. As already discussed above. Doctor-patient relationship, though basically commercial, is professionally, a matter of confidence and therefore, Doctors are morally and ethically bound to maintain confidentiality. In such a situation, public disclosure of even true private facts may amount to an invasion of the Right of Privacy which may sometimes lead to the clash of one person's right to be let alone" with another person. Disclosure of even true private facts has the tendency to disturb a person's tranquility. It may generate many complexes in him and may even lead to psychological problems. He may thereafter, have disturbed life all through. In the face of these potentialities and as already held by this Court in its various decisions referred to above. The Right of Privacy is an essential component of right to life envisaged by Article 21. The right however is no absolute and may be lawfully restricted for the prevention of crime, disorder or protection of health or morals or protection of rights and freedom of others...'

53. It was held in R. Rajagopal vs State of TN reported in AIR 1995 SC 264 :

‘.......... The right to privacy as an independent and distinctive concept originated in the field of Tort Law, under which a new cause of action for damages resulting from unlawful invasion of privacy was recognized. This right has two aspects which are but two faces of the same coin: (1) the general law of privacy which affords a tort action for damages resulting from an unlawful invasion of privacy and (2) the constitutional recognition given to the right to privacy which protects personal privacy against unlawful governmental invasion. In recent times, however, this right has acquired a constitutional status ..........’

54. In a recent judgment of one of this Court's Division Bench [6 CLR (HCD) (2018) Nurjahan Ruzi vs Bangladesh (per Mr Syed Refaat Ahmed, J)] the issue of right to privacy has been discussed. The Court held :

‘......... It is this Court's finding that such balance was indeed not struck in the facts by the Respondent No.6 and this stemmed from not only a misconceived requirement of disclosure of personal status by the applicant-Petitioner but also a misdirected inquiry into the primacy of her marital status in the facts. It is here that this Court finds that the requirement under the law is of a disclosure of marital status current and extant-as-evident from an existing sate of wedlock at the material time i.e., on the date of submission of the application of External Cadet Sub-Inspector It appears to this Court that the Respondents have veered towards an unauthorized scrutiny on that latter circumstance, thereby, unduly, unreasonably and unfairly burdening the petitioner with an obligation of disclosure not sanctioned or required in law.'

55. As we note from the submission made by the learned Counsel Mr Hossain, dignity and privacy are important values promoted by Islamic faith. It was submitted : ‘....... It is the girl's right to make a decision concerning her marriage, and her father or guardian is not permitted to override her objections or ignore her wishes. Prying into other peoples' private affairs and spying on their secrets is not permitted, even if they are engaged in sin, as long as long as they do it privately and not openly. Uqbah then said, 'Woe to you! Do not do that, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him) say, If one conceals the private affairs (of others), it is like reviving a girl who has been buried alive from her grave. [The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam By Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi at pages 314-316, 321-322] . The Islamic jurist further writes : During the Farewell pilgrimage the Prophet (peace be on him) addressed the asembly of Muslims, saying, Your lives, your honour, and your property are as sacred to each other as the sacredness of this your day, in this your month, and in this your city.

56. The impugned forms at clause No. 5 require the bride to make a statement as to her marital status and her sexual history, specifically stating whether she is virgin/widowed/divorced should be re-phrased for the sake of removal of the degrading and discriminatory entries. The forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/ divorced /previously married or is a Celibate. It is discriminating and arbitrary and created inequality violating the said provisions of the Constitution, negating the CEDAW obligations. Such requirements are violative of fundamental rights, in particular the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sex, the right to be treated in accordance with law, as guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution. Interference with such privacy also violates a women's right to personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 31 and 32 of the constitution. Inclusion of the Word "Kumari" instead of "Unmarried" is humiliating and degrading to the woman's personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 32 of the Constitution and contradicts with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) inasmuch as it has the effect of discrimination against woman on the basis of sex, also impairing the dignity of woman by invading upon their privacy.

57. However, since the Government vide SRO No. 84-Ain/2011 dated 10th April, 2011 inserted the following to the impugned kabinnama forms, the other terms of the Rule (with respect to the identities of the parties to a marriage etc.) are not required to be dealt with:

"৩। [জন্ম নিবন্ধন সনদ/জাতীয় পরিচয়পত্র/জুনিয়র স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (জে.এস.সি) বা মাধ্যমিক স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (এস.এস.সি) বা সমমানের পরীক্ষার সনদপত্র/মাতা, পিতা বা আইনগত অভিভাবক প্রদত্ত বয়স সংক্রান্ত হলফনামা অনুযায়ী বরের বয়স...............
৬। [জন্ম নিবন্ধন সনদ/জাতীয় পরিচয়পত্র/জুনিয়র স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (জে.এস.সি) বা মাধ্যমিক স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (এস.এস.সি) বা সমমানের পরীক্ষার সনদপত্র/মাতা, পিতা বা আইনগত অভিভাবক প্রদত্ত বয়স সংক্রান্ত হলফনামা অনুযায়ী কনার বয়স............"
This Court's declaration:

58. In view of the position expressed above, we are satisfied that this is a case which presents a situation where this Court should exercise its discretion to issue appropriate directions under Article-102 of the Constitution.

Thus the entry No. 5 in Forms No. 1601 is hereby declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect being discriminatory against women on the ground of sex and marital status in violation of Articles 28, 31 and 32 of the Constitution; The Respondents are hereby directed to take necessary action (preferably within a period of 6 (six) months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment) :

(i)to amend the entry No.5 in Bangladesh Forms No. 1601 (ফরম-খ) (Form-Kha) (kabinnama) appended to the Rules, by omitting the word "Kumari" in respect of brides, and be replaced with the following:

"5. Marital Status of the Bride: [Unmarried/ Divorced/Widow?
...... [In Bangla: কন্যা অবিবাহিতা বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা]

to insert the following in the said forms: "21. Marital Status of the Bridegroom: [Married/Unmarried/Divorced/Widower?] In Bangla : বর বিবাহিত/অবিবাহিত/তালাকপ্রাপ্ত/বিপত্নীক কিনা in the beginning of entry No. 21 keeping the existing sentence intact.

59. With these observations and directions, the Rule is disposed of.

60. The office is directed to communicate the order at once.

61. No order as to costs.

Khizir Ahmed Choudhury, J:

I have gone through the judgment authored by my lord Ms. Justice Naima Haider and I fully agree with the findings and ultimate result of the instant Rule but I would like to dwell some aspects which has bearing in the instant Rule.

63. In Form having framed under "Muslim Marriage and Talak Registration Rules 2009", some discriminatory remarks has been inserted in clause 5 which militates with clause 21 of the said form having clearly dealt in the findings of the judgment. Article 26 of the constitution of the People Republic of Bangladesh also clearly prohibits from making any law inconsistent with any provisions of the part 111 titled as "fundamental rights" which runs as follows:

1. All existing law inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, become void on the commencement of this Constitution.

2. The state shall not make any law inconsistent with any provisions of this Part, and any law so made shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.

3. ...........

64. As per Article 152 of the Constitution "Muslim Marriage and Talak registration rules 2009" is also law and, as such, remarks made in column 5 of form "Gha" to the effect that "কন্যা কুমারী" being discriminatory cannot be sustained.

65. Apart from this Article 27 also stipulates that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. Article 28 also postulates that the state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth and also stipulates that woman shall have equal rights with men in all spheres of the state and public life. Equally, Article 31 mandates that all citizens will enjoy protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law and only in accordance with law.

66. Another important aspect is that under Mohammadan law Muslim Marriage is a contract and it is necessary that the men or someone on his behalf and the women or someone on her behalf should agree to the marriage at one meeting and the said agreement should be witnessed by two adult witnesses. It can be termed a Civil contract but with passage of time and changed circumstances registration of marriages has became necessary and consequently in our country "the Muslim Marriage and divorce Registration Act 1974" has been enacted wherein section 3 of the said act finds provision for registration of marriages and also Nikah Registers are entrusted for registration of marriages and divorces. Consequent to the said act successive rules have been framed under which marriage and divorce are registered under specific forms and presently it is being done under " ফরম ‘ঘ’ মুসলিম বিবাহ ও তালাক (নিবন্ধন) বিধিমালা, ২০০৯ এর বিধি ২৮(১) (ক) অনুযায়ী বিবাহ রেজিস্টারী বহি”, So as the terms referred to in the said form Gha namely "কন্যা কুমারী" is not mandate of Muslim law, it should be deleted for harmonizing the status of bride and bride groom.

Consequently, from all perimeters it is amply clear that remarks made in clause 5 in form “ঘ” namely "কন্যা কুমারী " is clearly discriminatory and against the avowed spirit of our constitution and, as such, this inconsistent remark requires to be deleted.

End.

Though the petitioner tried to sit with them in Cox's Bazar Bar Association in several times but in vain. That the petitioner finding no other way cancelled the Irrevocable Power of Attorney on 11-9-2009 vide registered deed No. 25-12-2007. That the petitioner filed Mutation Case No. 1205 of 2006 and mutated his name in the B S. Khatian No. 4706 and the petitioner has been paying rents to the concerned authority regularly. That the petitioner filed an application to the respondents for permission to sell the allotted plot, against the said application to the Ministry of Housing and Public Works and the ministry issued a letter to the Executive Engineer, Cox's Bazar vide Memo No. sha-9/1- M- 26/2008/302 dated 7-5-2008 to send elaborate report regarding the ownership of the land.

That on 20-1-2016 the petitioner sent a Notice Demanding Justice through registered post with acknowledgement document and by special messenger to the respondents No.1-3 and prayed that the respondents permit the petitioner to sell the schedule property. That the respondent No. 3 issued a letter vide memo No. Shakha-9/1M-26/2008/38 dated 21-1-2016 to the petitioner denying to permit to transfer the schedule land with a malafide and arbitrary intention. That the said letter is impugned herein. Hence the writ petition.

6. Learned Advocate Mr Mr Sherder Abul Hossain, Advocate with Mr Md Ashraful Islam, Advocate with Mr Tanjil Mahmud, Advocate appeared for the petitioner while learned DAG Mr Noor Us Sadik Chowdhury along with Mr Prahlad Debnath AAG along with Mr Md Hafizur Rahman, AAG along with Ms. Farida Parvin Flora, AAG appeared for the respondent Nos. 1-7 and learned Advocate Mr Md Musharraf Hossain Mozumder appeared for the respondent No.9 .

7. Learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the final refusal in not allowing him to transfer the property vide memo no. Shakha-9/1M-26/2008/38, dated 21-1-2016 which is Annexure -H issued by the respondent No. 3 is without lawful authority and not sustainable. He agitates that the respondent No. 3 by his order dated 21-1-2016 refusing to allow the petitioner to transfer the property is arbitrary and is a slip shod order. He draws attention to Annexurer H and submits that the respondent No. 3 did not anywhere mention in his order their reason for not allowing the petitioner to transfer his property. He contends that admittedly the petitioner is still a lessee having being allotted the land in 1980 and has been continuing as a lawful lessee since over a period of 40 years. Upon a query from the bench regarding the respondent's contention as to some pending suits between the instant petitioner and some other individuals (persons), the learned Advocate for the petitioner agitated that whatever suit/case may be pending between the petitioner and some other individual/person do not concern the respondent Nos. 1-7 at all. He argues that such pending suit involve issues which are disputed matter of fact to be decided in the concerned civil court. He agitates that so far the respondents are concerned admittedly the petitioner still a lessee and the land is duly mutated in his name upon payment of rent, taxes, DCR etc. and which is clear from Annexure E of the writ petition. He draws attention to Annexure E which is an enquiry conducted by the respondents. He contends that nowhere in the enquiry report is there any negative indication or remark on any malafide nor any latches on the part of the petitioner. He continues that from the enquiry report it is clear that the property pursuant to allotment was duly mutated in the petitioners name followed by payment of rent, taxes, DCR etc in the name of petitioner who is the lawful and admitted lessee.

8. Upon another query from this bench regarding the respondent's contention that clauses 19 and 17 of the Lease Deed dated 27-12-1980 was not complied with, he argues that nowhere in the enquiry report nor by way of any other evidences could it shown be that clauses 19 and 17 was not complied with.

9. Regarding the issue of power of attorney granted by the petitioner to some other person subsequent to allotment, the learned Advocate for the petitioner strenuously argued that Power of Attorney is a legal right and which does not require any permission from the respondents. He submits that subsequent to any allotment of property power of attorney can be lawfully granted to any person for sake of convenience whatsoever for purpose of construction of building or any other reason. He reiterates that since after 40 years of the original allotment admittedly the petitioner is still a lawful lessee therefore the respondents have no legal right in not allowing him to transfer the property moreover without assigning any valid reason. He further submits that the allotment has not been cancelled and which is contemplated in clause 22 of the lease deed in the event of any default by the petitioner. He continues that therefore it is evident that the petitioner pursuant to the allotment by granting another person power by way of power of attorney to construct building on his behalf whatsoever, however did not deviate or otherwise depart from the terms of the deed. He submits that since the allotment has not been terminated therefore it is to be presumed that clauses 19 and 20 and also 22 of the lease deed was complied with. He argued that therefore it is the lawful right of the petitioner to obtain permission from the Respondents. He agitates that the respondent no. 3 without assigning any reason by way of slip shod order arbitrarily and whimisically refused the petitioner. He concludes his submission upon assertion that the Rule bears merit ought to be made absolute for ends of justice.

10. On the other hand, learned AAG Mr Prahlad Devnath appearing for the respondent No. 1-7 by way of filing affidavit in opposition opposes the Rule. From the affidavit in opposition he however mainly submits on some factual matters pertaining to some suits pending between the petitioner and some other individuals/persons. He submits that since some suits are pending between the petitioner and some others therefore pending the suit the respondents are not in a position to transfer the land. He further submits that the petitioners did not comply with some relevant clauses of the lease deed which stipulate a time of 2(two) years from the date of allotment to construct on the leased land and therefore the petitioner may not be allowed to lawfully transfer the property. He further submits that the petitioner did not act lawfully since he granted power of attorney to some other person after allotment of the property and further there are some pending suits between the petitioner and some other persons in the lower court. He made some other factual submissions regarding the reason of the respondents refusal not to allow the petitioner to transfer the land. Upon a query from this bench as to whether the respondents still acknowledge the petitioner as their lessee? the learned Assistant Attorney-General however concedes and admits that the petitioner is still a lessee of the government(Respondents). He concludes his submission upon assertion that however the Rule bears no merits ought to be discharged for ends of justice.

11. The learned Advocate for the respondent No. 9 who is the purchaser of the property from the petitioner substantively support the contention of the learned Advocate for the Respondents and concludes his submission upon assertion that the Rule bears no merit and ought to be made Absolute for ends of justice.

12. We have heard the learned Advocates for all sides, perused the application and materials on records. It is an admitted fact by both the parties that whatever the reason of refusal to transfer may be however the petitioner is still a lessee of the government since 1980.

13. For purpose of proper disposal of the Rule we have examined the lease deed which has been annexed as Annexure-A and which is dated 20-10-1980. For our purpose we have examined Clauses 3, 19, 20 and 22 of the lease deed. Clauses 3, 19, 20 and 22 of the lease deed reproduced hereunder:

"(3) That the constructions to be made on the demised property shall not cover more than two-thirds of the demised property and within two years from the date of commencement of the lease or within such further time as the Lessor may allow in his discretion, the tenant shall complete the building on the demised property of a house with all necessary outhouses, boundary marks , drains and appurtenance for the purpose of a residence including a septic tank of a pattern approved by the Chief Engineer, Public Works Department."

"(19) That the tenant shall not sell, charge, mortgage, exchange, gift away otherwise assign, sublet, encumber or in any way part with or dispose of the demise property or any part thereof before the construction of the buildings, outhouses and appurtenances hereby covenanted to be erected."

"(20) That subject to the provision of clause 19, the tenant shall be at liberty to transfer or sublet subject to the conditions of these presents the whole of the demised property subject to the obligation that the transfer shall be registered in the office of such authority as may be appointed by the lessor, and unless this is done the lessor will not be bound to recognise or accept any person as tenant of the demised property in place of the transferor."
14. Clause 3 of the lease deed contemplate that the property pursuant to being allotted t42 the lessee the lessee must construct on at least /3rd within a period of 2(two) years. Clause 19 and 20 of the lease deed also consist of similar provision. Clause 19 of the lease deed contemplate that in the absence of constructing house in the property the petitioner shall not have any right to transfer the property. Clause 20 of the lease deed however contemplate that subject to construction by way of building etc. in the land the lessee (tenant) shall be at liberty to transfer or sublet the property in whole or in part thereof whatsoever and in the case of transfer, the property shall be duly registered. It also contemplates that in the absence of registration the lessor shall not be bound to acknowledge the new transferee or new lessee whatsoever.

15. We have particularly perused clause 22 of the lease deed which contemplates that in case of failure to construct building within the stipulated time of 2(two) years, if any lessee fails to perform his part within that time the respondents shall be at liberty to terminate the lease and following such termination shall proceed accordingly with the relevant laws.

16. Now as mentioned above in this case the petitioner admittedly is still a lessee and which is conceded and admitted by the respondent government. In our considered opinion since the petitioner is admittedly still a lessee since 1980 and since his allotment has not yet been cancelled therefore it may be presumed and concluded that the petitioner did not deviate from the prescribed clause. We may safely presume that the petitioner followed the conditions in clause Nos. 3, 4, 19, 20 and other relevant clauses of the lease deed. It is only reasonable and logical to hold that if the petitioner was not in compliance with the conditions and terms of the lease deed, the lease deed would have been terminated by dint of clause 4 of the lease deed. But however the petitioner in this case is till date a lawful and legal lessee as admitted by the respondents.

17. Truly enough permission is required in accordance with the lease deed and under the other relevant laws. Before transferring any property the lessee is required to obtain permission from the concerned authority. However it must be borne in mind that refusing to allow transfer a property cannot be done arbitrarily and particularly in this case the petitioner has been an allottee since 1980 and a lawful lessee. While his refusing to be allowed permission to transfer his property the respondents must assign a cogent reason. In this case it is clear by way of Annexure-H dated 21-1-2016 that the respondents did not assign any reason. The order dated 21-1-2016 which is annexure-H denying the petitioner to allow him to transfer is a slip shod order with no explanation at all. Further we have examined the enquiry report (Annexure E). Upon careful examination of the findings of the enquiry report dated 21-8-2008 we do not find any negative comment against the present petitioner. It appears that the enquiry report expressly stated that pursuant to the allotment the lessee (petitioner here) have been paying taxes, DCR etc.

18. As to the power of Attorney being granted to some other person it is common knowledge that a power of attorney is a common factor and is often granted by the owner to some other person to construct/ sell or otherwise supervise the property for sake of convenience. We do not find anywhere anything in any other law which may indicate that permission is required from the respondents/authorities to grant power of attorney. Apparently the enquiry report found that there is a construction building also thereupon in the demised land. Therefore it may be safely concluded that the petitioner complied with the conditions/terms of the lease deed. Since the lease is still continuing and has not been cancelled therefore it is evident that the petitioners complied with the rules and conditions.

19. The learned AAG on behalf of the respondents agitated that there are some pending suits between the petitioner and some other person and for that reason transfer of the property to any other person is not possible.

20. It is a settled principle of law that property may be transferred by any person/ lessee/owner whatsoever to some other person even pending a suit. However it is also a settled principle of law that if there are any pending cases involved in that event the purchaser shall purchase or otherwise obtain the property from the transferor with all its rights and liabilities attached to such property whatsoever. Therefore the transferor may purchase the property and shall be transposed in the possession of the original lessee and he shall purchase the property pending any suit and the fate of the original suit shall decide the fate of the subsequent transferee of the property. Therefore the purchaser shall purchase the property bearing in mind that the fate of the property shall be decided depending on the fate of the suit.

21. From the foregoing discussions made above and under the facts and circumstances we are of the considered view that we do not see any legal bar nor any other bar as to why the petitioner cannot transfer the property to any other person. The respondent No. 3 by his slip shod order dated 21-1-2016 which is annexed as Annexure-H in the writ petition committed illegality in not allowing the petitioner to transfer the Plot No.50, Block-A, measuring an area of 5 Kathas of Mouza Jhilongjha, Upazila-Cox's Bazar, Cox's Bazar Sea Beach Area. He gave a slip shod and non speaking order. We find merit in this Rule.

22. In the result, the Rule is made absolute with direction and relying on the observations made above. The impugned letter vide Memo No. Shakha-9/IM-26/2008/38 dated 21-1-2016 issued by the respondent No. 3 which is marked as Annexure-H in the writ petition is hereby declared without lawful authority and if of no legal effect. The respondent Nos. 1-7 are hereby directed to permit the petitioner to transfer the Plot No. 50 , Block-A, Measuring an area of 5 Kathas of Mouza Jhilongjhc Upazila-Cox's Bazar, Cox's Bazar Sea Beach Area within a period of 90(ninety) days from the date of receiving of this judgment. Communicate this judgment at once.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BANGLADESH

High Court Division

(Civil Miscellaneous Jurisdiction)

First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 33 of 2021
With
Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020

City Bank Limited, represented by its Managing Director (Appellant)
VS
SM Delwar Hossain (Respondent)

Present:
Mr. Justice Md. Rezaul Hasan

Judgment Date: September 27, 2021

Md Sameer Sattar, Advocate For the Appellant.

Md Akteruzzaman, Advocate For the Respondent.
JUDGMENT
Md Rezaul Hasan, J: This appeal is directed against the impugned judgment and order No. 34 dated 22-1-2017, passed by the Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Bogura, in Miscellaneous Review Case No. 02 of 2014 (arising out of Civil Revision No.24 of 2013) allowing the Review and, thereby, giving effect to the order No.13 dated 21-1-2013, passed by the Senior Assistant Judge, 1st Court, Bogura, in Civil Suit No.390 of 2011.

2. Facts, relevant for disposal of this First Miscellaneous Appeal, in brief, are that, one SM Delowar Hossain filed Civil Suit No.390 of 2011 before the court of 1st Assistant Judge, Bogura, against the Managing Director, City Bank Limited and 3 others, praying for declaration that the termination order dated 14-7-2011, whereby the services of the plaintiff has been ended, is illegal, collusive, without jurisdiction, void, malafide, ineffective and not binding upon him. The plaintiff has also prayed for direction for payment of his salary as well as other reliefs, which he may be entitled to as per law. The case of the plaintiff is that, he was appointed as "Cash Sorter" on 27-9-1990, on probation, and thereafter his service was confirmed on 4-5-1991. Subsequently, the Bank has promoted him to the post of Senior Cash Officer. Later on, he was transferred to Bogura Branch against the post of "Chief Retailer". His further case is that, he has rendered his services with the satisfaction of the superior authority and has been enjoying his salary and other benefits accordingly. But, on 13-7-2011, when the plaintiff went to join his duty at Bogura Branch, he was prevented from joining and was asked to go to the Head Office. He then went to the Head Office of the Bank. But, Mr Jabed Amin and Head of Policy Ms. Khil Khil Newa detained him and compelled him to submit a resignation letter. Further case of the plaintiff is that, he lodged a GD entry on 23-7-2011, wherein he has stated all these facts and he was removed from the services in the name of termination, most arbitrarily and inhumanly and without issuing any prior notice. In these circumstances, causes of action has arisen and he was compelled to file this suit.

3. The defendants contested in the suit by filing written statement, on 26-11-2012, in which, they have denied all allegations made in the plaint and stated their own case at paragraph No. 10 of the written statements. The defence case, in brief, is that, the Bank is a juristic person and that it has a Service Rule applicable to the bank employees. According to that Service Rule, the Bank can terminate the services of any employee, including the plaintiff, as per clause 9.2.3, which is the privilege of the employer. Further case of the defendant was that, the plaintiff was not dismissed from his services and he was paid 3(three) month's salary, in lieu of 3(three) months notice period and was given other benefits as were admissible as per law. Accordingly, the plaintiff has no case, nor any cause of action to file this suit and he is not entitled to get any relief as prayed for.

4. Along with the written statement, the defendants have filed an application under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, (Annexure-D) for rejection of the plaint alleging that, the plaintiff has been terminated as per the Service Rules of the bank and he was given all service benefits as per the Service Rules and that it was a termination simpliciter. Therefore, the plaint is liable to be rejected.

5. The trial court heard the parties on this application for rejection of the plaint. It was of the opinion that, the plaintiff has served in the Bank for long period and there was no adverse remarks on his service report. The trial court has also recorded that no notice was served upon the plaintiff, nor he was given any opportunity to show cause. On these findings, the trial court had rejected the application for rejection of the plaint, vide its judgment and order dated 21-1-2013.

6. Against the said judgment and order of the trial court, the Bank preferred Civil Revision No. 24 of 2013, before the District Judge, Bogura. Being transferred, the Civil Revision No. 24 of 2013 was heard by the Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Bogura, who, in presence of both the parties, had allowed the civil revision by its judgment and order dated 23-3-2014, on contest, and had set-aside the judgment and order of the trial court dated 21-1-2013. Against the said order of the lower revisional court, the plaintiff has filed Miscellaneous Review Case No. 2 of 2014 before the same court (Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Bogura). The lower revisional court, after hearing the review petition, vide it's judgment and order dated 22-1-2017, has allowed the application for review, set-aside the judgment and order dated 21-1-2013, passed revision, and upheld the judgment and order dated 21-3-2013 of the trial court.

7. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order of the revisional court dated 22-1-2017, the Bank has filed this application under section 115(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which was subsequently converted into First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 33 of 2021 by an order dated 4-12-2019, whereupon the Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020 has been issued.

8. Both the First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 33 of 2021 and Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020 have been taken up for analogous hearing and disposal.

9. Learned Advocate Mr Sameer Satter appeared for the defendant-appellant. He, having placed the Memo of Appeal alongwith other documents annexed thereto, 1st of all submits that, a mere perusal of the termination letter will show that, this was termination simpliciter and the plaintiff was given service benefit in lieu of 90 days notice period as well as other benefits admissible in This case. He also submits that, termination of service is a privilege of the employer and this is permitted by Clause No. 9.2.3 of the Service Rules of the Bank. He next submits that, this suit filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable and if a terminated employee is allowed to file a suit then it will open a flood-gate to file several cases, while termination is a mode recognized to relieve on from his job. He also submits that, the trial court has utterly failed to understand the legal aspect of this case and it had erroneously passed the order dated 21-1-2013. He also submits that, no stigma or any kind of blame has been imposed upon the plaintiff. Therefore, he continues, the plaintiff had no cause of action, moreso when he has been paid all his service benefit as per Rules and Regulations of the Bank. He next submits that, the revisional court has discussed the case of both the parties as well as it had considered the decisions cited before it and had arrived at a correct judgment and order dated 23-3-2014. But, the learned Advocate submits that, the revisional court ought not to have admitted the Review Case No. 02 of 2014 in as much as the condition laid down in Order 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for entertaining an application for review, did not exist in this case. Moreover, the said Review Petition No. 02 of 2014 has not been filed upon any of the grounds enumerated in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and, therefore, the revisional court, in admitting the Review Petition No.02 of 2014, has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it and the impugned judgment and order dated 22-10-2017, whereby it has set-aside it's own judgment and order dated 23-3-2014 passed in Civil Revision No.24 of 2013. He next submits that, once the revisional court has passed the order dated 24-10-2013 it has become functus-officio. Therefore, the learned Advocate submits that, in passing the impugned judgment and order dated 22-1-2017, passed in Review Petition No. 02 of 2014, the lower revisional court has committed grave error of law, that has resulted in error in the decision passed as well as it has occasioned in a serious failure of justice. Moreover, it has created a bad precedence by setting aside it's own order in purported exercise of the review jurisdiction when none of the grounds were available. He concludes that, this appeal has merit and the same may kindly be allowed.

10. Learned Advocate Mr Md Akter-uz-zaman has appeared on behalf of the respondent-opposite party. He, on the other hand, submits that, the trial court has rightly passed the judgment and order dated 21-1-2013, whereby it has rejected the application for rejection of the plaint. He next submits that, the order dated 21-1-2013 of the trial court is a speaking order and the plaintiff served in the Bank for a long period and there is no earthly reason to terminate his service and his termination is not in the interest of the Bank. He next submits that, the revisional court, vide it's judgment and order dated 23-3-2014, passed in Civil Revision No. 24 of 2013, although set-aside the order of the trial court in Review Petition No. 02 of 2014, it has reassessed the entire case of the parties and has rightly allowed the review application on contest and thereby it has secured the ends of justice. As such, the impugned judgment and order passed by the court below, in exercise of it's review jurisdiction, do not call for any interference by this Court. He next submits that, the plaintiff is an officer of the Bank and was promoted to the higher post because of his meritorious career and an employee cannot be left to the caprices of the Bank Management. Moreover, the learned Advocate proceeds on that, the Bank has not given any release letter to the plaintiff which shows a clear case of malafide exercise of the power. He next submits that, the defendants have violated the direction given in the BRPD Circular Letter No. 07 dated 28th May, 2015, issued by Bangladesh Bank. Besides, he further submits that, the defendants have denied to the plaintiff the opportunity to re-pay the house loan by installments to be deducted from his salary during continuation of his service and has denied to him his livelihood. He concludes that, this appeal has no merit and the same is liable to be dismissed and the Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2021 may kindly be discharged.

11. I have heard the learned Advocates appearing for both the parties, perused the Memo of Appeal, application for stay and the documents annexed to the petition and other materials on record.

12. I find from the termination letter that it is apparently a termination simpliciter and the plaintiff was given service benefit in lieu of 90 days notice period.

13. In the light of the facts and circumstances of this case, as revealed from the pleadings of the parties and the materials available in the record, I have taken into consideration the BRPD Circular Letter No. 07 dated 28th May, 2015, that reads as follows:

"ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক/প্রধান নির্বাহী, বাংলাদেশ কার্যরত সব তফসিলী ব্যাংক।
প্রিয় মহোদয়,
ব্যাংকে পরিপালনের জন্য কতিপয় নির্দেশনা প্রসঙ্গে।
সাম্প্রতিককালে লক্ষ্য করা যাচ্ছে যে, ব্যাকিং সময়সূচীর পরে কার্যদিবস শেষে কর্মকর্তা-কর্মচারী বিশেষ করে মহিলা কর্মকর্তা/কির্মচারীদেরকে ব্যাংকে অবস্থানের জন্য বাধ্য করা হচ্ছে। তাছাড়া, তফসিলী ব্যাংকের কর্মকর্তাগণের নিকট হতে চাকুরীতে ইস্তফা, অযৌক্তিক বরখাস্তকরণ কিংবা অপসারণ এবং পরবর্তী আর্থিক সুবিধা প্রাপ্তিতে হয়রানিসহ বিভিন্ন বিষয়ে অসংখ্য অভিযোগ উত্থাপিত হচ্ছে। ফলে বিভিন্ন রকমের জটিলতার উত্তব হচ্ছে বা সুষ্ঠু মানব সম্পদ ব্যবস্থাপনার ক্ষেত্রে অন্তরায়।
এতদসূত্রে ব্যাংক কর্তৃক পরিচালিত বিভিন্ন নিয়মাচার পর্যালোচনান্তে এ মর্মে সিদ্ধান্ত গৃহীত হয়েছে যে, ব্যাংকিং সময়সূচীর পরে অর্থাৎ সন্ধ্যা ৬.০০ ঘটিকায় কার্যদিবস শেষে ব্যাংকে অবস্থানের জন্য বাধ্য করা যাবে না। বিশেষ অফিসীয় প্রয়োজনে যদি কোন মহিলা কর্মকর্তা/কর্মচারীদেরকে ব্যাংকিং সময়সূচীর পরেও ব্যাংকে অবস্থান করতে হয় তবে তাদেরকে উপযুক্ত নিরাপত্তা ও পারিশ্রমিক প্রদান করতে হবে।
আরো উল্লেখ্য, ব্যাংক কর্তৃক ইচ্ছামাফিক ঢালাওভাবে কর্মকর্তা/কির্মচারী ছাটাই রদ করতে হবে। নিয়োগকালে পেশাদারিত্বের সাথে প্রার্থী যাচাই-বাছাই করতে হবে। নিয়োগকৃত কর্মকর্তা/কর্মচারীদেরকে প্রয়োজনীয় প্রশিক্ষণের মাধ্যমে উপযুক্ত করে গড়ে তুলতে হবে। এছাড়া, ব্যাংকের কর্মকর্তাগণের চাকুরীতে ইস্তফা, চাকুরী হতে বরখাস্তকরণ কিংবা অপসারণ এবং পরবর্তী আর্থিক সুবিধা প্রাপ্তির ক্ষেত্র International Labour Organazation Conventions, বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ ও সময়ে সময়ে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক প্রদত্ত নির্দেশনার যথাযথ প্রতিফলন ঘটিয়ে ব্যাংকের সার্ভিস রুলস সংশোধন করতঃ তার যথাযথ পরিপালন নিশ্চিত করতে হবে।
এ নির্দেশ অবিলম্বে কার্যকর হবে।"
14. This BRPD Circular Letter No. 07 dated 28th May, 2015, has been issued by the Bangladesh Bank in exercise of the powers vested in it, by clause (Ka) and (Gha) of sub-section (1) of section 45 of the Bank Company Act, 1991, that stipulates as follows:

"৪৫। ৩১) বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক যদি এই মর্মে সন্তুষ্ট হয় যে,
(ক) জনস্বার্থে, বা
(খ)
(গ)
(ঘ) কোন ব্যাংক-কোম্পানীর যথাযথ ব্যবস্থাপনার নিশ্চিত করার জন্য সাধারণভাবে সকল ব্যাংক-কোম্পানীকে, অথবা বিশেষ কোন ব্যাংক-কোম্পানীকে নির্দেশ প্রদান করার প্রয়োজন, তাহা হইলে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক যথাযথ নির্দেশ জারি করিতে পারিবে এবং সংশ্লিষ্ট- ব্যাংক-কোম্পানী উক্ত নির্দেশ পালান করিতে বাধ্য থাকিবে।"
15. Therefore, as per provisions of sub-section (1) of section 45 of the Bank Companies Act, 1991, the BRPD Circular No. 7 dated 28-5-2015 has the force of law and the directions given in it are mandatory and shall prevail over the Service Rules of all Banks. The Banks are legally bound to comply with all the directions given in this circular as well as to amend their Services, if so required, to bring them in conformity to these directions given by the Bangladesh Bank.

16. I have also taken into consideration that, the termination letter was issued before issuance of the circular. But, it does not permit an arbitrary action, nor would protect any colorable action of any kind. Here, the bank is the employer, while the plaintiff as well as all other employees and officials (executives and non-executives) all are employees of the bank. Hence, in all cases of termination, discharge, removal or dismissal it has to be proved that the action was taken bonafide and the interest of the Bank, which is substantially run by public money.

17. Every authority, whosoever, must exercise the powers vested in it to secure the end for which such power has been vested. No colorable exercise of power is sustainable in law. No power can be exercised without a guideline or on a pick and choose basis or in violation of legitimate expectation of a person aggrieved by exercise of such powers. The master and servant Rule, that served the interest of the capricious masters of the colonial era and had governed the private sector employment for decades, should now yield to the principles of fair play legitimate expectation and access to justice.

18. Inspite of all these facts, the paramount and consistently adopted principle is that, whoever is vested with any power is duty bound to exercise such power bonafide, fairly, and to further the causes for which such power has been vested. Each and every power is an entrustment. It cannot be exercised by anyone merely for the reason that such power is available in his or her hands. One, who exercises any power, must also prove that the exercise of such powers was not intended to settle any personal issue, nor tainted by any personal or other bias, not abrupt, not peculiar, nor based on pick and choose, not arbitrary. Onus to prove that such power has been exercised bonafide is on him who exercised the power. Any exercise of such power, in a public company, to victimize any person shall not be indulged by any court of law as in the case of the services under any public or statutory body.

19. The learned Advocate for the bank submits that, the plaintiff is a worker and he ought to have follow the procedure laid down in the Labour Act, 2006, before filing this suit, while he should have filed the case before the labour court. The learned Advocate for the plaintiff submits that, he is not a worker, rather he is an officer of the bank, since subsequently he has been promoted to the post of an officer. However, these are matter to be raised before and decided by the trial court.

20. Be that as it may, in view of the discussion made above, I am of the opinion that, the petition for rejection of plaint was not competent in this case and was rightly rejected by the trial court. Because, the petition for rejection of the plaint was based on the defence case and defence material, not on the averments made in the plaint. A petition for rejection of the plaint should be considered only with reference to averments made in the plaint. However, the trial court may frame, in an appropriate case, issue of law and decide the maintainability point as per provisions of Rule (2) of Order 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 1908.

21. The bank should issue release order in favour of the plaintiff in as much as it has asserted that this was a case of termination simpliciter.

22. In view of the discussion recorded above, this appeal and civil Rule should be disposed of.

Order
Accordingly, the FMA No. 33 of 2021 and the Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020 are disposed of. The trial court is directed to decide the maintainability point, as per Rule (2) of Order 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, immediately, if such an issue of law is pressed before it. Otherwise, it should dispose of this case within 60 (sixty) working days from the date of receipt of this judgment and order. The Bank is further directed to issue release order to the plaintiff within 30 (thirty) working days from the date of receipt of this judgment and order and to submit an affidavit of compliance. The order of stay granted earlier by this court is hereby vacated. In exercise of the power vested in this Court under Article 112 of the Constitution of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, the General-Manager, BRPD, Bangladesh Bank, is directed to examine or cause to examine the Service Rules of all Banks to ensure that the Banks have complied with the directions given in BRPD Circular No. 07 dated 28-5-2015, since it has the force of law as per clause (Ka) and (Gha) of sub-section (1) of section 45 of the Bank Company Act, 1991. They should submit a compliance report within next 90 (ninety) working days to this Court, through the Registrar of this Court. However, if so prayed for, this time limit may be extended by the court for just reason. This judgment shall not have any bearing on the merit of the case. The trial court shall decide the issues on merit and independently. Let copies of this judgment be sent to the Governor, Bangladesh Bank, to the Registrar of the High Court Division, Supreme Court of Bangladesh and to the General-Manager, BRPD, Bangladesh Bank, information and doing the needful. No order as to cost. Copies of this judgment also be sent to the courts below at once.

Judgment
Sheikh Hassan Arif, J:
Since the questions of law and facts involved in the aforesaid appeal and civil revision are almost same, and they have arisen from the same suit between the same parties, the same have been taken up together for hearing and are now being disposed of by this common judgment.

1.1 First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 178 of 2019 is directed, at the instance of the plaintiff in Title Suit 500 of 2018, against Order No. 08 dated 19-2-2019 passed by the First Court of Joint District Judge, Dhaka in the said suit thereby rejecting the application seeking temporary injunction filed by the plaintiff.

1.2 Rule in Civil Revision No. 52 of 2020 was issued, at the instance of the same plaintiff in the same suit, calling upon the opposite parties to show cause as to why the Order No. 17 dated 17-10-2019 passed by the said Court in the said suit, namely Title Suit No. 500 of 2018, thereby allowing an application filed by the defendant No.1 under sections 7 and 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 and thereby staying all further proceedings of the said Title Suit.
2. Background Facts:

2.1 Since the appellant and the petitioner in both the appeal and civil revision are same person, namely the plaintiff in the title suit concerned, we will refer him as plaintiff in this matter for the sake of convenience in our discussion.

2.2 Facts, relevant for the disposal of the appeal and Rule, in short, are that the appellant/petitioner, as plaintiff, filed the said Title Suit No. 500 of 2018 against the land owner and two developers seeking Specific Performance of Contract dated 10-4-2014 (Annexure-D in Civil Revision) between the plaintiff and the said two developers and land owner in respect of some flats and proportionate land as mentioned in schedule "Ka" and "Kha" to the plaint.

2.3 The case of the plaintiff, in short, is that the defendant No.1, being owner of 5 katha land as mentioned in 'Ka' schedule to the plaint, entered into a registered development agreement, being No. 8801 dated 28-7-2011, with defendant No.2 developer company (in short "Nagor Vision") to develop the said property. Accordingly, an irrevocable power of attorney giving extensive power was executed by the land owner (defendant No.1) on the same day in favour of the said developer (Nagar Vision). That during continuation of construction, since Nagor Vision fell into financial crisis, it entered into another development agreement with defendant No. 4-developer vide registered deed No. 9364 dated 13-10-2013 for development of the said property. Subsequently, when the defendant Nos. 1-5 could not continue with the construction/development work because of financial crisis, they executed a registered Baina with the plaintiff on 10-4-2014 for transfer of the developer's portion of the land and flats in favour of the plaintiff. That, as per the terms of the said Baina, the plaintiff paid the entire money, namely Taka 2,74,22,996.45. However, since the defendants were still unable to complete the development work, the plaintiff paid further amount of Taka 56,77,003.55 and, accordingly, the plaintiff paid in total Taka 3,31,00,000. That, in the meantime, the construction of the building has been completed and the land owner (defendant No.1) has got her portion of 50% flats as well as car parking spaces in possession and rented out some of them to the tenants. However, the defendants started delaying in giving registered kabala in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the remaining 50% of flats and lands and, accordingly, the plaintiff issued legal notice, but got no positive response. Thus, the plaintiff has filed the said suit seeking Specific Performance of the said Baina dated 10-4-2014.

2.4 Along with the said suit, the plaintiff filed an application under Order 39, rules 1 and 2 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking injunction for restraining the defendant Nos. 1 and 3 from evicting the tenants of the plaintiff in the suit property. The said application was objected by defendant Nos. 1 and 3 by filling written objection mainly contending that the baina in question had adopted the terms and conditions of the earlier development agreement between defendant Nos. 1 and 2 and, as such, by such adoption, the said baina incorporated the arbitration clause as mentioned in clause 17 of the said development agreement. This being so, it was contended by the said defendants by way of such written objection that the relief could not be sought in the way as had been sought by the plaintiff by filling the said suit, rather the plaintiff should have invoked arbitration clause as per Clause 17 of the said development agreement between defendant Nos. 1 and 2 as adopted in the baina in question.

2.5 Thereupon, the Court below, after hearing the parties, rejected the said application seeking temporary injunction vide impugned Order No. 8 dated 19-2-2019 on the ground that the baina in question in fact adopted and incorporated the arbitration clause as stipulated in Clause 17 of the earlier development agreement between defendant Nos. 1 and 2. Being aggrieved by this order of rejection, the plaintiff has preferred the aforesaid First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 178 of 2019. Upon admission of the said appeal and on an application filed by the plaintiff, this Court issued the connected Rule, being Civil Rule No. 272 (FM) of 2019, and, at the time of issuance of the Rule, vide an ad-interim order dated 3-4-2019, directed the parties to maintain status-quo in respect of possession and position of the suit property for a period of 06 (six) month, which was subsequently extended for further periods in due course.

2.6 Thereafter, the defendant No. 1 filed an application before the Court below under section 7 read with section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 seeking stay of the further proceedings of the said suit on the ground that the baina in question adopted an arbitration clause as incorporated in Clause-17 of the development agreement between defendant Nos. 1 and 2 and, as such, it was contended that the suit in question should be stayed allowing the parties to resolve their disputes through arbitration. The said application was opposed by the plaintiff by filling written objection mainly contending that the arbitration clause, as incorporated in Clause-17 of the said development agreement dated 28-7-2011, was only applicable to the parties to the said development agreement and that the parties to the baina in question could not be bound by such arbitration clause as incorporated in the said development agreement. It was further contended that although by Clause-12 of the baina agreement, terms and conditions of the earlier development agreement dated 28-7-2011 was adopted to the effect that the parties would be bound by the stipulations in the said agreement, such stipulation as incorporated in Clause-12 of the baina will only apply to the developers portion of the building and in no way will bind the parties to go for arbitration for resolving the dispute arising out of the said baina.

2.7 Thereupon, the Court below, after hearing the parties, allowed the said application filed by the defendant No.1 vide impugned order dated 17-10-2019 and thereby stayed all further proceedings of the said Title Suit No. 500 of 2018 by invoking section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001. Being aggrieved by this order, the plaintiff has invoked the revisional jurisdiction of this Court under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the aforesaid Rule in Civil Revision No. 52 of 2020. At the time of issuance of the Rule, this Court, vide ad-interim order dated 12-1-2020, stayed operation of the said impugned order dated 17-10-2019 for a period of 06(six) months, which was subsequently extended for further periods in due course.

2.8 The Appeal and Rule are opposed by defendant- respondent Nos. 1 and 3 (defendant-opposite party Nos. 1 and 3) through learned advocate Mr Md Monzur Alam Khan, who also filed an application for vacating the order of stay, which was kept with the record.
3. Submissions:

3.1 Mr Probir Neogi, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant and petitioner in both the matters, mainly submits that there are three agreements between the parties, namely that the first development agreement between defendant Nos. 1 and 2, the 2nd development agreement between defendant No. 2 and defendant No. 4 and the 3rd one is the baina in question between the defendants and the plaintiff. Therefore, according to him, although Clause-12 of the registered baina agreement dated 10-4-2014 has stipulated about the binding effect of the stipulations in the 1st development agreement dated 28-7-2011, such clause will only apply in respect of the developers' portion of the properties, namely 50% of the flats and land, and, as such, the arbitration clause, as incorporated in Clause 17 of the 1st development agreement dated 28-7-2011, will not be applicable in respect of the said baina. According to him, it is the cardinal principle of interpretation of any document that for interpretation of any clause therein the entire document has to be examined and considered and the said particular clause has to be interpreted as against the context of the entire agreement. Therefore, according to him, clause 12 of the baina dated 10-4-2014 read with Condition No.1 of the said deed makes it clear that the reference made in the said clause in respect of the conditions of the 1st development agreement will only be limited to the extent of share of the developer in the concerned property. In support of his such submissions, he has referred to different pages of the book authored by our late lamented constitutional lawyer Mr Mahmudul Islam, namely the book titled "Interpretation of Statutes and Documents", Mahmudul Islam, 1st Edition, pages 306-307 and 355-357. Accordingly, he submits that both the impugned orders being mainly based on the finding of the Court below that the subsequent baina dated 10-4-2014 has incorporated the arbitration clause as stipulated by Clause No. 17 of the first development agreement dated 28-7-2011, the same cannot stand in the eye of law.

3.2 As against above submissions, Mr Md Monzur Alam Khan, learned advocate appearing for the defendant-appellants (defendant-opposite parties), submits that Clause-12 of the baina in question has left no doubt about incorporation of the arbitration clause as incorporated in the development agreement dated 28-7-2011, particularly when the said baina was executed not only between the plaintiff and the subsequent developer, rather it was executed between the plaintiff and both the developers and the land owner. This being so, according to him, under no circumstances, the said Clause-12 of the baina in question can be interpreted in an isolated way thereby applying the same only to the developers' portion of the land particularly when the question of arbitrability of the dispute between the parties arises. According to him, although the baina has been executed by the parties in respect of developer's portion of the developed building and land, the said baina has specifically referred to the terms and conditions of the first development agreement between the defendant Nos. 1 and 2. Therefore, according to him, any dispute, as may arise from the said baina in question, has to be resolved by reference to two earlier development agreements between defendant No.1 and 2 and in between defendant No.2 and 4. This being so, he submits that under no circumstances the dispute arising from the said baina in question can be resolved without invoking the stipulations as incorporated in the said first development agreement dated 28-7-2011.
4. Deliberations, Findings and Orders of the Court:

4.1 To address the issues raised by the parties and to understand the issues whether the baina in question has in fact adopted the arbitration clause as stipulated by Clause 17 of the first development agreement, we have examined the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, 2001, in particular the definition of the term 'arbitration agreement' (1TA71) and the provisions under section 10 of the said Act. For our ready reference, both the provisions, namely section 2 (Dha) and section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 are reproduced below:

"২।(ঢ) "সালিস চুক্তি” অর্থ সুস্পষ্টভাবে বিধৃত চুক্তিগত বা ছুক্তিবহির্ভূত-ভাবে পারস্পরিক সম্মতিক্রমে আইনানুগ সম্পর্ক হইতে উদ্ভুত কিংবা উদ্ভুত হইতে পারে এইরুপ সকল বা যে কোন বিষয়ের রিরোধ সালিসের মাধ্যমে নিষ্পত্তি করার জন্য উক্ত আইনানুখ সর্ম্পকের পক্ষণণ কর্তৃক সালিসে প্রেরণ করা সম্পর্কিত চুক্তি;

১০। বিরোধের সালিসযোগ্যতা--(১) সালিস চুক্তির কোন পক্ষ বা উক্ত পক্ষের অধীন দাবীদার কোন ব্যক্তি সালিসের মাধ্যমে মীমাংসা হইবে মর্মে মতৈক্য হইয়াছে এমন কোন বিষয়ে চুক্তির অন্য কোন পক্ষ বা অনুরূপ পক্ষের অধীন দাবীদার কোন ব্যক্তির বিরুদ্ধে কোন আদালতে কোন আইনগত কার্যধারা রুজু করিলে, উক্ত কার্যধারায় লিখিত জবাব দাখিল করিবার পূর্বে যে কোন পক্ষ বিষয়টি সালিসে অর্পণ করিবার জন্য সংশিষ্ট আদালতে আবেদন করিতে পারিবে।
(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন আবেদনের প্রেক্ষিতে আদালতের নিকট বদি প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, সংশ্লিষ্ট সালিস চুক্তি বিদ্যমান আছে এবং উহা বাতিল, অকার্যকর বা সালিস দ্বারা নিষ্পত্তির অযোগ্য হয় নাই, তাহা হইলে আদালত বিষয়টি সালিসে প্রেরণ করিবে এবং উক্ত কার্যধারা স্থগিত করিবে।

(৩) উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন আবেদন আদালতের বিবেচনাধীন এবং আইনগত কার্যধারা বিচারাধীন থাকা সত্তেও সংশ্লিষ্ট বিষয়ে সালিস সূচনা করা, অব্যাহত রাখা এবং সালিসী রোয়েদাদ প্রদান করা যাইবে।"

4.2 It appears from the above quoted definition of the term "সালিস চুক্তি", as provided by the said Act, that it has referred to the relationship between the parties under the agreement or beyond the agreement. It has also referred to a future dispute which may arise between the parties within the terms of the agreement or beyond the terms of the said agreement. 

Therefore, it appears from the term "সালিস চুক্তি" that it has been defined by our Legislature in a very wide way thereby incorporating any dispute arising out of the relationship between the parties within the terms of the agreement and beyond the terms of the agreement. Same intention of the Legislature is apparent from the clear words as mentioned in the above quoted provisions under section 10 of the said Act. Two types of parties: to an arbitration agreement have been referred to therein, namely that the specific parties to such agreement or any party claiming under such parties to such agreement. Apart from above, Explanation to section 9 (2) of the said Act categorically recognizes such arbitration agreement by way of reference to a contract containing such arbitration Clause [see MR Engineers vs Som Datt Builders, 2009 (3) RAJ 448 (SC)]. These being the specific provisions of law without giving any space for interpretation by the Court by referring to any other external materials or text books, we are of the view that an arbitration clause in an agreement may be adopted by other parties who are claiming under the parties to the said agreement if the agreement in between such other parties adopts the said arbitration clause in the main agreement for resolving the dispute arising from the said subsequent agreement. We find support of this position of law in one case decided by the full bench of the Calcutta High Court in Dwarkadas Co. vs Daluram, AIR 1951 Calcutta-10.

4.3 With the above position of law, let us now examine the issues raised by the parties. Admittedly, the plaintiff in the suit concerned entered into the registered baina dated 10-4-2014 (Annexure-D to Civil Revision) as the First Party to the said contract. The Second parties to the said contract are Mrs. Amin Maria (land owner-defendant No.1), represented by the developer Nagor Vision Development Ltd. (defendant No. 2), and Nijhum Property Ltd., the subsequent developer (defendant No.4). Further admitted position is that the said agreement or baina was executed in respect of the developer's portion of the property, namely 50% of the property. Admittedly, defendant No.2 (Nagor Vision) and defendant No.4 (Nijhum properties) became parties to the said baina and executed the same mainly on the strength of the first development agreement, namely agreement dated 28-7-2011 (Annexure-D I to the Civil Revisional application). Therefore, it appears that the land owner (defendant No.1) entered into a development agreement with defendant No.2 in 2011 and, pursuant to the same, executed an irrevocable power of attorney giving extensive power in favour of defendant No. 2 for the development of the land and building thereon. Thereafter, on the strength of this agreement dated 28-7-2011 and the irreparable power of attorney executed on the same day, Nagor Vision (defendant No.2) entered into another development agreement with Nijhum properties (defendant No.4) for development of the said building because of its financial difficulties in continuing with the construction.

4.4 It now appears from the baina in question that because of the difficulties in continuing with such construction due to scarcity of funds, the said parties, namely the land owner (represented by Nagor Vision) and subsequent developer (Nijhum Properties) executed the said baina and thereby gave commitment to transfer 50% of the developed property (flats and proportionate land) in favour of the plaintiff. By virtue of Clause 12 of the baina in question, the parties to the baina agreed, amongst others, that the conditions in the first development agreement, namely agreement dated 28-7-2011, would be binding on them. Clause 12 of the said baina is reproduced below:

"১২। বিগত ২৫-৫-১১ ইং তারিখে সম্পাদিত রেজিস্টিকৃত ব্যাপক ক্ষমতা সম্পন্ন একই আমমোক্তার নামা দলিল যাহার দলিল নং ৮৮০২ এবং একই তারিখে সম্পাদিত ভূমির মালিক ও ডেভলপার এর মধ্যে রেজিঃকৃত চুক্তিনামা দলিল যাহার দলিল নং ৮৮০১ এ অনুযায়ী এর তপসিল সম্পত্তি কিংবা ডেভোলপমেন্ট এর সমুদয় হিস্য। অত্র ১ম পক্ষের বরাবর হস্তান্তর হইবে এবং উক্ত দলিলের সকল শর্ত মানিতে বাধ্য থাকিব।"

4.5 Admittedly, the first development agreement dated 28-5-2011 has an arbitration clause under Clause 17. The exact Clause 17 of the said development agreement is also reproduced below for our ready reference:

"১৭। অত্র চুক্তিপত্র ল্মায় পক্ষদ্ধয়ের মধ্যে চুক্তি বিষয়ে কোন বিরোধ সৃষ্টি হইলে উক্ত বিরোধ নিষ্পত্তির জন্য ১ম ও ২য় পক্ষ উভয়ের সন্মতিক্রমে তিনজন সালিসকারক নিয়োগ করা হইবে। আরবিট্রেশন এ্যাক্ট-২০০১ এর বিধান্মতে উক্ত সালিসকারকের রায় বা পরামর্শ সকল পক্ষ মানিয়া চলিতে বাধ্য থাকিবেন।"

4.6 Therefore, the question arose in the aforesaid appeal and Civil Revision is as to whether this Clause 17 of the first development agreement should be regarded as one of the clauses or conditions of the baina in question. As stated above, subsequent development agreement with Nijhum properties and the baina in question were executed by defendant Nos. 1-5 basically on the strength of the said first development agreement dated 28-7-2011 between the land owner and Nagor Vision. This basis of every subsequent transaction is further reflected from the context of the baina in question. Admittedly, the second party in the said baina are the said land owner and subsequent developers (Nagor Vision and Nijhum Properties) and they jointly agreed to transfer the developer's portion of the properties, namely 50% of the developed properties, in favour of the plaintiff, and the suit in question has been filed for enforcement of the said registered baina.

4.7 Therefore, under no circumstances, the said registered baina can be examined in an isolated way. In other words, the said baina, or the terms of the said baina, cannot be examined with its entirety ignoring the terms of the said original development agreement dated 28-7-2011 and the power of attorney executed thereon. Different terms of the said baina in question also acknowledge such correlation. The said baina has also made specific reference in respect of the said development agreement between the land owner and Nagor Vision. Therefore, if the said baina categorically stipulates that the terms of the said development agreement, namely development agreement dated 28-7-2011, will be binding on the parties to the said baina, it cannot be said that the arbitration clause incorporated in the development agreement is not incorporated or adopted by the parties in the said baina. It cannot be denied that the parties to the said baina, before execution of the same, have themselves read the terms and conditions of the said development agreement dated 28-7-2011 including Clause 17 therein, and upon realizing the terms and conditions thereof, they have agreed to execute the said baina incorporating Clause 12 therein stipulating that the parties to the said baina would be bound by the terms and conditions of the said development agreement dated 28-7-2011.

4.8 Therefore, as stated above the parties to the said baina are now claiming to enforce their rights, or opposing such enforcement, under the parties of the said development agreement. Although the plaintiff was not a party to the said development agreement, by executing baina in question with Clause 12 therein, he has agreed to be bound by the terms of the said development agreement including Clause 17 thereof. Therefore, as per the definition of the 'arbitration agreement', as provided by section 2 (Dha) of the Arbitration Act 2001, the said baina should be termed as an agreement which arose from the said development agreement dated 28-7-2011 incorporating an arbitration clause therein under Clause 17. Thus, it cannot be denied that this baina dated 10-4-2014 also contains an arbitration agreement.

4.9 This being the position, it cannot also be denied that the parties claiming or opposing their rights and title under the said baina are doing so under the parties to the arbitration agreement. Accordingly, the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, 2001, in particular section 10 of the same, may be invoked in case of any proceeding initiated by any of such parties before any Court in Bangladesh. In this regard, we have examined relevant parts of the book authored by Mr Mahmudul Islam, namely the book titled "Interpretation of Statutes and Documents". However, the contents of those parts are not relevant in the facts and circumstances of this case.

4.10 In view of above, since in the suit concerned the defendant No.1, who is admittedly a party to the said development agreement dated 28-7-2011 and the baina in question, has the right to file an application before the Court seeking stay of further proceedings of the said suit by referring to the arbitration clause, or arbitration agreement, between the parties, the Court below has committed no illegality in rejecting the application filed by the plaintiff seeking temporary injunction as well as in staying the further proceedings of the suit concerned by invoking section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001. Thus, we do not find any merit in both the aforesaid appeal and Rule. Accordingly, both of them should fail.

4.11 In the result, the appeal is dismissed. Connected Rule, namely Civil Rule No. 272 (FM) of 2019, is also disposed of. Ad-interim order, if any, thus stands recalled and vacated. Rule issued in Civil Revision No. 52 of 2020 is also discharged. Ad-interim order, if any, passed therein stands recalled and vacated. Communicate this.

High Court Division

Present:
Mr. Justice Md. Badruzzaman (Dist.-Mymensingh)

Civil Revision No. 2757 of 2021.

Nurul Kabir......Petitioner
VS
Sodaha Ludhi Shikdarpara Jame Masjid and others .......... Opposite Parties

Counsels:
.......... Opposite Parties Judgement Date : November 09, 2022

Tushar Kanti Roy, Advocate—For the Petitioner. Md Faysal Hasan Arif, Advocate with Mahuz Bin Yousuf, Advocate—For Opposite Party No. 1.

Judgment
This Rule was issued calling upon opposite party No.1 to show cause as to why judgment and order dated 13-1-2021 passed by learned Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Chattogram in Civil Revision No. 156 of 2019 affirming an order dated 6-1-2019 passed by learned Senior Assistant Judge, Satkania, Chattogram in Other Suit No. 262 of 2016 rejecting an application under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of plaint should not be set-aside.

2. At the time of issuance of Rule, this Court vide ad-interim order dated 6-12-2021 stayed further proceeding of Other Suit No. 262 of 2016 for a period of 6(six) months.

3. Facts, relevant for the purpose of disposal of this Rule, are that opposite party No.1 as plaintiff instituted Other Suit No. 262 of 2016 against the present petitioner and others in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Satkania, Chattogram praying for a decree of declaration of title to 0.40 acre suit land and another declaration that BS Khatian Nos. 1398, 1399 and 2895 in respect of the suit land were wrongly prepared and published in the name of Md Kamal Uddin and his mother Obeda Khatun instead of the plaintiff, declaration of heba deed executed by Md Kamal Uddin in favour of defendant Nos. 3-7 dated 4-8-2009 being No. 1817 and the Mutation Khatian No. 3949 are illegal, void, without jurisdiction and for such misdeeds the title and possession of the plaintiff to the suit land have not been affected in any way.

4. Defendant No. 6 entered appearance in the suit and then filed an application under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of plaint against which the plaintiff filed written objection. The trial Court, upon hearing of both parties, vide order dated 6-1-2019 rejected the application fixing the next date for filing written statement.

5. Being aggrieved by said order dated 6-1-2019 defendant No. 6 preferred Civil Revision No. 156 of 2019 before the learned District Judge, Chattogram which was transferred to learned Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Chattogram for disposal who, upon hearing both parties, disallowed the revision vide judgment and order dated 13-1-2021 by affirming the order passed by the trial Court.

6. Being aggrieved by said order dated 13-1-2021, defendant No. 6 has preferred this application under section 115(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the Rule and order of stay, as stated above.

7. Plaintiff-opposite party No.1 has entered appearance by filing vokalatnama to contest the Rule.

8. Mr Tushar Kanti Roy, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner by taking me to the plaint, application for rejection of plaint and the orders passed by the Courts below submits that the suit is barred by the principle of res judicata and also barred under section 6A and 102 of the Waqfs Ordinance, 1962 inasmuch as that in view of provisions under section 6A(4) of the Waqfs Ordinance, 1962 the Administrator of Waqfs is empowered to take steps for correction of record-of-rights and the plaintiff, who is a stranger to the waqf estate, has no locus standi to institute the suit and as per the provisions under section 102 of the Ordinance 'Civil Court' has no jurisdiction to decide title in respect of waqf property and accordingly, the plaint should have been rejected by the trial Court. Learned Advocate submits that the revisional Court without considering the relevant provisions of law illegally disallowed the revision by affirming the order of the trial Court and, as such, committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice and accordingly, interference is called for by this Court.

9. As against the above submissions, Mr Faysal Hasan Arif, learned Advocate appearing for opposite party No.1 submits that the question of locus standi as well as res-judicata are mixed questions of law and fact which cannot be decided in disposing of an application under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure and these issues can only be decided only upon taking evidence during trial. Learned Advocate further submits that admittedly, the suit property is waqf property but the previous mutawalli recorded the waqf property in his name along with his mother in the RS Khatians instead of the name of waqf estate and thereafter, transferred the same without any permission from the Administrator to defendant Nos. 3-7 by way of declaration of heba deed and since the previous mutawalli and his son, the present mutawalli, did not protect the interest of the Waqf, the plaintiff filed the present suit for protection of the waqf property. By referring to the provisions under section 2(8) of the Waqfs Ordinance, learned Advocate submits that 'person interested in a waqf' includes a beneficiary and any person who has a right to worship or to perform any religious rite in a mosque, idgah, imambarah, dargah, maqbara or other religious institution etc, may file a suit to protect the waqf property when the mutawalli goes against the interest of the waqf estate.

10. Learned Advocate further submits that though section 6A of 'The Waqfs Ordinance' conferred power upon the Administrator of Waqfs to take immediate steps for correction of record-of-rights which has not recorded in the name of the waqf estate but, in the instant case, the Administrator did not take any steps to correct the record-of-rights. Learned Advocate further submits that in the instant suit not only the record-of-rights has been challenged but also the deed of declaration of heba which has been executed by the previous mutawalli transferring the waqf property to his relatives and mutation khatian have been challenged, the Administrator has no jurisdiction to decide whether the said deed or record-of rights were legal or whether by said deed the defendants have acquired any right, title and interest to the suit land by way of said declaration of heba deed and accordingly, the suit is not barred by law.

11. Learned Advocate finally submits that the provisions under section 102 of the Waqfs Ordinance provides that no decision or order of the Administrator can be questioned in any suit or other proceeding in Court except as otherwise expressly provided in the Ordinance but in the instant case, decision or order of the Administrator has not been challenged and accordingly, the revisional Court committed no illegality in refusing to reject the plaint by affirming the order of the trial Court and, as such, interference is not call for by this Court.

12. I have heard the learned Advocates, perused the plaint, application filed under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the orders passed by the Courts below as well as relevant provisions of law to come to a proper decision.

13. On perusal of the plaint, it appears that the suit has been filed by "ছদাহা লধুী সিকদার পাড়া জামে মসজিদ" represented by the Vice-President of the Committee of the mosque. In the averment of the plaint, the plaintiff stated that 0.40 acre suit land is waqf property out of which 0.30 acre was dedicated by Begumjan and others vide registered deed of waqf dated 17-6-1954 being No. 4345 in favour of the plaintiff mosque and handed over possession thereof in its favour and by said deed Danu Miah was appointed as first mutawalli. Thereafter, Syed Ahmed Mohuri transferred 0.10 acre suit land to the plaintiff vide waqf deed dated 23-11-61 being No.5677 and Md Kamal Hossain, the predecessor of defendant Nos.3-7, was appointed as mutawalli of the waqf estate and in his tenure he recorded said 0.40 acre suit land in his name along with his mother instead of the name of the waqf estate i.e. the plaintiff and thereafter, said mutawalli transferred the suit land in favour of his children (defendant Nos.3-7) by registered declaration of heba deed being No. 1817 dated 4-8-2009. It has also stated in the plaint that the defendants are now claiming title to the waqf property as their personal property and, as such, the waqf estate filed the suit represented by the Vice-president of the mosque Committee praying for a decree of declarations, as stated above.

14. As per averments of the plaint, the father of defendant No. 6, who was previous mutawalli recorded the waqf property in his name along with his mother instead of the name of waqf estate and also transferred the suit land by declaration of heba deed dated 4-8-2009 to defendant Nos. 3-7. This averment of the plaint is not denied by defendant No. 6 who is also claiming that he is the present mutawalli of the waqf estate.

15. Under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure the plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:

(a) Where it does not disclose a cause of action,
(b) Where the relief claimed is undervalued and the plaintiff, on required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so,
(c) Where the relief claimed is properly valued but the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so,
(d) Where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law, Provided that the time fixed by the Court for the correction of the valuation or supplying of the requisite stamp-paper shall not exceed twenty-one days.

16. It is not the case of the defendant that the plaint does not disclose cause of action or the relief claimed is undervalued or the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped and the plaintiff failed to supply requisite stamp-paper as per direction of the Court. The defendant has sought for rejection of the plaint mainly on the ground that the suit is barred by law in that the plaintiff has no locus standi to file the suit and the suit is barred by the principle of res judicata and under sections 6A (4) and 102 of the Waqfs Ordinance, 1962.

17. It is settled principle of law that question of res-judicata is a mixed question of law and fact which cannot be decided upon an application filed under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure but the same can only be decided at the time of trial upon taking evidence. On the face of it, the suit has filed by the waqf estate and the plaint has signed by Janu Mia claiming to be empowered by the mosque Committee representing the waqf estate for protection of the interest of the waqf. On the other hand, defendant No.6, Nurul Kabir is claiming to be the present mutawalli of the waqf estate and he is legally authorized to represent the waqf estate. But both parties are admitting that the suit property is waqf property belonging to the mosque. Though defendant No. 6 is claiming himself as mutawalli but he did not come forward to file the suit for protection of the interest of the waqf estate.

18. Now question arises whether the waqf estate itself can file a suit for protection of its own interest and if answer is positive, who will represent the waqf estate?

19. Sub-section (1) of section 6A of the Waqf Ordinance, 1962 provides that 'any immovable property belonging to any waqf estate shall be recorded in the record-of-rights in the name of the waqf and shall be represented by the designation of mutawalli, Receiver or Administrator, as the case may be.'

20. Sub-section (4) of section 6A of the Ordinance also provides that 'if any immovable property belonging to any waqf estate is not recorded in accordance with the provisions of this section, the Administrator shall take immediate steps for correction of the record- of-rights.

21. In the instant case, admittedly, the record-of-rights of the suit property was not recorded in the name of waqf estate but the same has been recorded in the name of previous mutawalli and his mother. Accordingly, the Administrator of Waqfs should have taken immediate steps for correction of record-of rights under sub-section (4) of section 6A of the Waqfs Ordinance. By filing supplementary affidavit learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the Administrator of Waqfs.by order dated 30-3-2015 (Annexure-C-1) directed the petitioner (mutawalli) to take steps for correction of record-of-rights in the name of waqf estate. But, it appears that the petitioner (defendant No. 6) for unknown reasons, did not take any steps in view of the order passed by the Administrator of Waqfs dated 30-3-2015 as yet.

22. Section 56 (1) of the Waqfs Ordinance makes a clear bar of transfer of waqf property by way of sale, gift, mortgage or exchange by the mutawalli without the previous sanction of the Administrator. Sub- section (4) of section 56 also provides that 'where a mutawalli transfers a waqf property in contravention of sub-section (1) and afterwards himself becomes the owner of the property, the mutawalli shall, on the direction of the Administrator, reconvey the property to the waqf. Sub-section (5) of section 56 also provides that 'any transfer made in contravention of the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be an act of malfeasance and breach of trust for the purpose of sub-section (1) of section 32. Section 32 of the Ordinance provides provision of removal of mutawalli on the allegation of breach of trust, mismanagement, malfeasance or of any act of the mutawalli causing loss of the waqf property.

23. It appears that the previous mutawalli transferred the waqf property in favour of his children (defendant Nos. 3-6) which has been challenged in the suit. Admittedly, no unction was obtained before the transfer of the suit property by the previous mutawalli. As per section 56(3) of the Ordinance, such transfer shall be declared void, if the Administrator applies to the Civil Court in this behalf. No such action has been taken by the Administrator nor he proceeded against the previous mutawalli under section 32 of the Ordinance. On the other hand, though the Administrator vide order dated 30-3-2015 directed defendant No.6 to take steps to prepare record-of-rights in the name of the waqf estate but he did not comply with the said order and the Administrator did not take any action against
defendant No.6 for non-compliance of his order dated 30-3-2015.

24. Procedure as to when the Administrator may institute a suit or proceeding in his own name in a Court to protect the interest of a waqf property has been provided in section 83 of the Ordinance which reads as follows:

"83. If there is no mutawalli or the mutawalli refuses or neglects to act in the matter, within a reasonable time, the Administrator may, in his own name, institute a suit or proceeding in a Court against a stranger to the waqf or any other person-(a) for the establishment of right, title and interest in a waqf property, or
(b) for confirmation of possession in a waqf property, or
(c) for the recovery of any waqf property wrongfully possessed, alienated or leased, or (d) ................
(e) .............
(f) For any other relief in the interest of a waqf he may consider necessary."

25. The provisions under section 83 clearly suggest that in the event of refusal or negligence on the part of the mutawalli in the matter, the Administrator of Waqfs is empower to institute a suit or proceeding in a Court in his own name against a stranger to the waqf or any other person to protect the right, title and interest of a waqf property. In other words, the Administrator has no authority to pass a decree against such person like a civil Court declaring right, title and interest of a waqf property, or confirmation of possession of a waqf property, or of recovery of possession of any waqf property wrongfully possessed, alienated or leased.

26. The Waqfs Ordinance, 1962 has defined `a person interested in the waqf,' in section 2(8) as follows:
"person interested in a waqf' includes a beneficiary and any person who has a right to worship or to perform any religious rite in a mosque, idgah, imambarah, dargah, maqbara etc or other religious institution and establishment connected with the waqf or to participate in any religious or charitable institutions under the waqf.

27. There is no provision in the Waqfs Ordinance, 1962 prohibiting 'a person interested in the waqf,' as defined in section 2(8) of the Ordinance, or 'the waqf estate itself,' as the case may be, to establish the right, title and interest of the waqf by filing a suit or proceeding in a Court in the event of failure on the part of the Administrator of Waqfs or mutrawalli in taking necessary steps under sections 6A, 56 or 83 of the Ordinance to protect the interest of the waqf.

28. Accordingly, I am of the view that, being a person interested in the waqf, the vice-president of the mosque committee has locus standi to institute the suit representing the waqf estate for protection of its interest.

29. On the other hand, section 102 of the Waqfs Ordinance provides that except as otherwise expressly provided in this Ordinance, no decision or order of Administrator shall be questioned in any suit or other proceeding in any Court'. In the instant case, it appears that, the plaintiff did not challenge any such order or decision of the Administrator.

30. In that view of the matter and given the facts and circumstances of the present case, the present suit is not barred under any provision of the Waqfs Ordinance. Accordingly, the plaint cannot be rejected on the ground that the suit is barred by law. As such, the Court of revision committed no illegality in dismissing the revision by affirming the order of the trial Court, rejecting the application for rejection of the plaint.

31. In that view of the matter I find no merit in this Rule.

32. In the result, the Rule is discharged, however without any order as to costs. 33. The order of stay granted earlier is hereby vacated.
The trial Court is directed to proceed with the suit and conclude the trial expeditiously.

First Appeal No. 151 of 2006.


Alauddin and others --------- Appellants
VS
Narayan Chandra Shil being dead his heirs: 1(a) Keshob Chandra Shil and others --------- Respondents

Judgement Date : October 31, 2022 

ABM Siddiqur Rahman Khan with Md Rafiqul Islam Faruque, Advocates—For the Appellant. ABM Matiur Rahman with Nahid Sultana, Advocates—For Respondent No. 1.

Judgment

Md Ali Reza, J:

This appeal at the instance of defendants 6 and 7 is directed against the judgment and decree dated 2-5-2006 passed by the District Judge, Narayanganj in Title Suit No. 02 of 1988 arising out of Probate Case No. 12 of 1984.

2. Respondent No. 1 Sree Narayan Chandra Shil (since dead) as petitioner filed Probate Case No. 12 of 1984 in the Court of District Judge, Narayanganj on 25-11-1984 for granting probate of the will dated 14- 8-1943. The probate Case was subsequently transferred to the Court of Subordinate Judge, Narayanganj and renumbered as Probate Case No. 75 of 1985. The appellants namely Alauddin and Amina Begum being 3rd party to the will filed an application on 3-1-1987 for their addition as opposite party and they were added as opposite parties 6 and 7 on 8-2-1987. Opposite party 6 then filed written objection on 28- 5-1988. Later on, the case was transmitted to the Court of District Judge who considering the written objection converted the probate case to Title Suit No. 2 of 1988 by order 41.

3. The case of the petitioner-plaintiff-respondent is that the suit land belonged to Shoshi Mohon Shil who had 5(five) sons named Jagadish, Robindra, Brindabon, Khetra Mohon and Shadhon. Jagadish, Robindra and Brindabon left this country for India in 1940 and lived there permanently. Khetra Mohon lived separately in Tongi. The youngest son Shadhon was taken in adoption in his childhood by his aunt through ritual participated by his brother Shoshi Mohon Shil and accordingly Shadhon was grown up there with and by his aunt. Subsequently, Shadhon being inspired to the ideals of Islam embraced the same and changed his name to Mohammad Shahjahan and started living in the address in Dakshin Khan, Uttara. Thus, Shoshi Mohon Shil being abandoned by his family started living in the house of his eldest brother Nagorbashi. Nagorbashi at his own cost took proper care of Shoshi with maintenance and medication and Shoshi was satisfied with that. Shoshi desired to make a will in favour of Nagorbashi and expressed such intention to the local respectable persons and consequently executed the same on 14-8-1943 in presence of witnesses. Previously no will had been executed by Shoshi. Nagorbashi or his successors were empowered to take probate. Shoshi himself read the contents of the will and signed the same with full understanding in presence of the witnesses and scribe. The petitioner filed the case for granting probate with the original copy of the will.

4. The Court kept the will in the safe custody by order 2 dated 29-11-1984.

5. The case of opposite party-defendant-appellant No. 1 as made out in written objection is that the three sons of Shoshi Mohon named Jagadish, Rabindra, Brindabon went to India permanently before 1947 and another son Khatro Mohon predeceased his father. Shashi Mohon died in 1959 leaving behind his youngest son Shadhon as his only successor. Shadhon became owner in possession. He was neither
adopted to his aunt nor lost his title in his paternal property. Shoshi never executed the will and the same is forged, fraudulent, illegal and inoperative. Nagarbashi or his heirs did not acquire any right, title and interest in the suit property. Shadhon while maintaining title and possession in the suit land was inspired by the ideals of great Islamic religion and accepted the same on 17-7-1967 when he was about 22 years old. Subsequently, due to necessity of money he sold the suit land to Alauddin and his wife Amena on 03-10- 1983 by 03(three) registered kabalas and delivered possession. Alauddin and Amena are opposite parties 6 and 7 respectively. Earlier the plaintiff-respondent filed Title Suit No. 194 of 1983 which was dismissed on 27-6-1985. The petitioner has no title and possession in the suit land. The suit is liable to be dismissed.

6. The Court of District Judge framed as many as 5(five) issues as to maintainability, limitation, whether the will filed by the plaintiff is genuine or not, whether the plaintiff has right and possession in the suit land and whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree as prayed for.

7. In course of trial plaintiff examined 3(three) witnesses and filed the will which was marked as Exhibit 1. On the other hand, the defendant 6 examined 03(three) witnesses but he did not file any document.

8. The Court of District Judge upon hearing the parties and perusal of evidence held that the plaintiff petitioner has been able to prove the case and he is entitled to have the order of probate and accordingly the suit was decreed on 2-5-2006.

9. The defendant-opposite parties 6 and 7 being aggrieved by the impugned judgment preferred the instant appeal.

10. Mr ABM Siddiqur Rahman Khan with Mr Md Rafiqul Islam Faruque, learned Advocates appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted that the impugned judgment is bad in law and liable to be set-aside. Mr Khan submitted that the lower Court erred in law in granting probate although according to section 63 of the Succession Act read with section 68 of the Evidence Act, two attesting witnesses are required to be examined but the plaintiff-petitioner did not take any such step in the instant case. The plaintiff also did not prove the testamentary capacity of Shoshi Mohon to the effect that at the time of execution he was in a sound and disposing state of mind and he understood the nature and effect of such disposition and put his signature on his own free will. He further submitted that the learned District Judge did not consider that the appellants being purchasers from Shadhon alias Shahjahan constructed house in the suit land thus respondent cannot claim on the basis of will which is forged and fraudulent. He laid much emphasis on suspicious circumstance and submitted that the instant probate case was filed long after 40 years from the date of execution of the alleged will in 1943. The case of the plaintiff on the alleged adoption is also not proved in evidence and the will also does not have any such recital in its body. He further submitted that Title Suit No. 194 of 1983 filed at the instance of the plaintiff-respondent for declaration of title against the same party since was dismissed the petitioner is not entitled to any remedy. The will since being surrounded by suspicious circumstance the same cannot be considered the testamentary disposition of the testator. In support of his submission he has referred the case of Biswaswar Das Karmakar and others vs Sasanka Mohan Das and others reported in 35 DLR (AD) 315, Khitindra Chandra vs Jalada Devi 35 DLR (AD) 102, Paresh Chandra vs Hiralal Nath and others 36 DLR (AD) 156, Jogendra Nath vs Amulya Chandra and others 44 DLR (AD) 147, Narendra Nath vs Sunil Kumar 1994 BLD (HCD) 10 -= 45 DLR 567, Janki Narayan vs Narayan Namdeo (2003) 2 SCC 91, Rur Singh vs Bachan Kaur (2009) 11 SCC 1, Kanchan Bala vs Gita Rani 14 BLC 472, Bhagirat Barman vs Haricharan 4 BLC (AD) 234, Oom Prokash vs Shoroshoti Bai AIR 1998 MP 226 and Thirty Sam Shroff vs Shiraz Byramji AIR 2007 Bom 103. He finally submitted that the petitioner did not even mention the time of death and amount of asset of the testator and the case is also barred under section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

11. Mr ABM Motiar Rahman, learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-respondent submitted that the appellant cannot challenge the grant of probate under section 283(1)(c) of the Succession Act. The appeal is not maintainable because the appellants are not aggrieved as defined under the law and the revocation case is not maintainable and they have no locus standi to challenge the probate Case. The three kabalas dated 3-10-1983 include fictitious land and those are invalid documents under section 28 of the Registration Act. Moreover, the appellant did not even file and prove those documents in evidence. He finally submitted that the respondent is entitled to get the aid of section 90 of the Evidence Act in the given facts and circumstances of the present case and the impugned judgment calls for no interference by this Court being passed upon proper appreciation of evidence. He has referred the case of Sree Moti Charu Bala Sen vs Abul Hashem and others reported in 33 DLR (AD) 254 and ADC (Revenue) vs Orun Kumar 6 BLC 354.

12. We have heard the learned Advocates for both sides and perused the evidence on record and gone through the impugned judgment and the grounds taken in appeal.

13. It is admitted that Shoshi Mohon had 05(five) sons named Jagadish, Rabindra, Brindabon, Kethromohon and shadhon alias Shahjahan, Jagadish, Rabindra, Brindabon permanently left this country for India before 1947. Khetro Mohon lived separately in Tongi and died during the life time of his father. The plaintiff-respondent claims that Shadhon was adopted to his maternal aunt. Subsequently, he embraced Islam on 17-7-1967 and named himself as Shajahan through affidavit dated 27-7-1967 in which he asserted that he was about 22 years old at that time. Thus it appears that admittedly he was born in 1945 after two years of the execution of will dated 14-8-1943 (Exhibit 1). So, it can be safely held that he had no personal knowledge about the will or its execution. Defendant 6 now appellant denied the case of adoption raised by respondent. Respondent Narayan is the son of propounder Nagarbashi who is the brother of testator Shoshi. The son of Shoshi named Shadhon alias Shahjahan is said to have sold the suit land to the appellant by 3(three) documents dated 3-10-1983. Appellant 2 is the wife of appellant 1 but she did not file any caveat or contest the suit. Defendant 6 did not even file their documents. Defendants 6-7 in order to contest the probate case filed application for their addition on 3-1-1987. The then Subordinate Judge allowed the application on 8-2-1987 only on the finding that they had good reason to be added as party to the litigation. It is absolutely surprising how the Subordinate Judge found good reason without any document and beyond the settled law. However, the respondent did not go to the Higher Court against such order. But in the instant appeal this Court is not fettered to examine whether the order dated 8-2-1987 was rightly passed or not. The main question is whether the appellant got any interest in the estate of the testator so as to be called upon to come and see the proceeding before the grant of probate as provided under section 283 of the Succession Act. In order to entitle a person to come and see the proceeding before the grant of probate he must show that he is interested in the estate of the deceased. Here the purchaser-appellant did not even produce their documents in evidence. Moreover, in the evidence it appears that both DW 1 and DW 2 claimed to be transferee and transferor respectively to those documents clearly admitted that those documents were registered in Tongi Sub registry office instead Rupganj and the vendor had no paper to show any land belonging to him in Tongi. Law is settled that document holding fictitious property is invalid under section 28 of the Registration Act. So the appellant have simply failed to show that they have any interest in the estate of the testator.

14. The interest in the estate of the testator within the words of section 283 of Succession Act means an interest through the testator. A person who claims outside or independently of the will or claims adversely to the testator and disputes his right to deal with the property cannot be deemed to claim any interest in the estate of the deceased. The crucial point in this case is whether the appellant claimed any interest in the estate through the testator and since they do not and cannot do so they had no locus standi to be added as a party or question the execution or attestation of the will in this probate proceeding. This aspect of the case has long ago been settled in Charu Bala case reported in 33 DLR (AD) 254. This Charu Bala case was affirmed in the case of Shubra Nandi Mojumder vs Begum Mahmuda Khatun reported in 42 DLR (AD) 133. In Shubra Nandi's case, caveator Mahmuda claimed interest through an agreement executed by the testator Sharat Kumar himself and filed application for her addition in the probate proceeding. Consequently, Leave was granted and our Honorable Appellate Division referring to Charubala case held that the point has been settled and there is no scope for taking different view. A
Division Bench of this Court also relied upon the same principle in the case reported in 6 BLC 354.

15. It appears that in all cases referred to by the appellant the caveator happens to be claiming through testator as heir or reversioner but in the instant case the appellants claimed independently. So the main submission of the appellant on technicality of suspicious circumstance relying upon those referred cases bears no value and falls through. In the event of contesting the case by Shahjahan himself may arise the question of suspicious circumstance or whether Shoshi was competent or in a sound and disposing state of mind or possessed testamentary capacity at the time of execution of Exhibit 1 dated 14-8-1943. In fact, admittedly Shahjahan was born in 1945 and he had no knowledge whether Nagarbashi resorted to any fraud, undue influence and coercion in course of execution by testator Shoshi. Moreover, paragraph 15 (xiv) of T Romesh case (online version) referred to by the appellants shows that such allegations on fraud etcetera brought about by the caveator with regard to execution have to be proved by him.

16. Shadhon alias Shahjahan is sealed with a case of adoption. PW-1 Narayan is the paternal cousin of Shahjahan and PW-2 Rabindra is the brother of Shahjahan. They deposed on adoption. PW 2 is the significant witness because as an heir he was entitled to the property left by his deceased father if he would have opposed the will. He is the disinterested witness. He supported the case of adoption. On the other hand, DW-1 Alauddin admitted in evidence that Shadhon lived in the disputed house with his father but Shadhon alias Shahjahan as DW-2 himself admitted that his uncle Banabashi maintained him and in 1967 he lived in Manikdi Tejgaon and his present address is Dakshin Khan, Uttara. DW 3 also supported that Banabashi maintained Shadhon. The possession of Shadhon alias Shahjahan is material in the instant case in order to defeat the case of adoption. Shahjahan as well as the appellant has to make out a definite case that before sale to the appellants in 1983 Shahjahan lived in his paternal house. But admittedly things are different here. Even the affidavit dated 27-7-1967 shows his address was Balughat, Cantonment, Tejgaon in 1967. Therefore it is held that the earlier possession of vendor Shahjahan in the suit land is not proved in evidence.

17. The will was executed in 1943. The appellant claimed to have purchased the land in 1983 from Shajahan. PW 3 stated in evidence that the appellant tried to enter into the suit land after purchase from Shajahan for which criminal case was started and he was convicted. He further stated that he has home in a portion of the land. There is no specific evidence on the entry of the appellant in the suit land. As discussed above, Shajahan's possession was not proved. In this context it is understood that after purchase in 1983 appellant forcibly had entered into a portion of the suit land. Since Shajahan had no possession, the appellant's possession, if any, claiming under Shajahan is not believable. But it transpires that he is a trespasser and law is settled that a trespasser cannot maintain his illegal possession against the real owner.

18. Learned Advocate for the respondent submitted that the will was executed in 1943 and it was a very old event so it was not possible to prove it by direct evidence. The will was produced from the proper custody without objection. So there is a presumption under section 90 of the Evidence Act that the will was duly executed and attested. Learned Advocate for the appellant strongly opposed this argument. He drived our attention to paragraph 14(b)(i), 14(e)(ix) of T Romesh Case and submitted that presumption under section 90 does not apply to will because wills have to be proved in terms of section 63(c) of the Succession Act read with section 68 of the Evidence Act.

19. To understand the intention and purpose of a law all the relevant sections of that particular law must be read together. From a combined reading of sections 283(1)(c) and 63(c) of the Succession Act, it appears that the party who wants to assail a will relying on section 63(c) must at first satisfy the requirement of section 283(1)(c) that the attacking party-caveator coming under section 284 must be a party claiming interest in the estate through testator and if such party claims independently of the will cannot be said to have interest in the probate case. In the instant case the appellant claims independently and he even did not produce his documents before the Court and the documents also are said to have been tainted with fictitious property. In such a situation the appellant-caveator cannot get the benefit and question the validity of the will under section 63 where he has no legal right or interest under section 283 of the Succession Act. The ratio of the case of Kanchan Bala reported in 14 BLC 472 as referred to is similarly not applicable in the present case because in that case Kanchan Bala was claiming not independently but through testator according to section 283 of the Succession Act.

20. In the case of Md Abdul Motin Kazi vs Govt. of Bangladesh reported in 11 ADC 133 interpretation of law on section 90 of the Evidence Act has been laid down. In the instant case there is no evidence to show that Nagarbashi ever played any unscrupulous role in course of execution of the will (Exhibit-1). Rather the appellant-caveator being a third party to the will did not even bother to produce their documents challenging the will. His conduct appears to be unscrupulous. Exhibit-1 came from proper custody and was more than 30(thirty) years old and on its face it is presumed that the same was executed by Shashi Mohon in a sound disposing state of mind. Relaying on the authority of the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Munna Lal vs Mst. Kashi Bai AIR (34) 1947 PC 15 the presumption in cases of execution and attestation of will under section 90 of the Evidence Act was drawn by a Division Bench in the case of Mst. Saran vs Abdul Rashid reported in PLD 1950 Sind 131. In the case of Swarna Kottoyya vs Karancheti Vardhamma reported in AIR 1930 Mad 744, the similiar view was taken long ago.

21. Considering the fact and circumstance of the present case it appears that a presumption, therefore, arises under section 90 of the Evidence Act that Exhibit-1 evidencing the will is a genuine document and validity executed.

22. It has been stated in paragraph 3 of the application (now plaint) of the probate case that the plaintiff respondent is empowered to take the probate after the death of propounder Nagarbashi. Clause 5 of the will (Exhibit-1) also shows the same and, as such, the respondent has become the propounder under section 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure read with sections 268 and 295 of the Succession Act. Respondent as PW 1 stated in evidence that his father could not file the probate case during his life time for his illness. Learned Advocate for the appellant strongly submitted that this long delay in filing the probate case would raise suspicion and he referred the judgment of Patna High Court passed in the online case of Hari Nath Thakur vs Sri Bhagwan Thakur. In the referred case the objection was also filed by the persons claiming through testator. The fact of the case is also different from the instant case. It transpires that after purchase in 1983 this appellant has been causing disturbance in the peaceful possession of the respondent who was at peace before such transfer. But according to the line of events he was forced to file this case because his back was against the wall. Minorities are under pressure in every country's social system. Many times they are deprived of basic rights and legal facilities. Respondent did not file this case until he was compelled to do the same after being threatened and subsequent illegal trespass of the appellant in around 1987. Without the guarantee of fundamental human rights and the rule of law no nation can attain perfection. Justice is established when the idea that what is injurious to others is injurious to oneself comes to the mind of the people of the society. When there is inequality in the society, people move away from the concept of morality and treat the weak with injustice. It disrupts social behavior and state principles. This kind of injustice can be removed from the society through well thought out and specific application of law. The technicalities of the law should be used sparingly with caution keeping in mind that justice shall not come undone. In the instant case, it is sad to experience that appellant pleads with the technicality of suspicious circumstance without producing any document. This Court is reluctant to accept such submission.

23. Appellant did not file and prove any paper of Title Suit No. 194 of 1983 and the matter in issue of that suit as alleged is apparently not the same. Question of res judicata does not arise at all. As discussed above appellants have no interest in the estate through testator under section 283 of the Succession Act and their access to this proceeding is shut down. For the reasons stated above we are not inclined to interfere with the judgment and decree passed by the District Judge and accordingly this appeal having no merit is dismissed.
Communicate this judgment to the concerned Court. Send down the lower Court's record.

Mr Mohammad Sazzad Ali Chowdhury, learned Advocate for the petitioners submits that the petitioners did not do anything in view of transfer or possession of above land on the basis of above power of attorney deed nor they have any claim of title and possession over above land. The petitioners had no knowledge about the creation of above deed of power of attorney and the executants of the deed of power of attorney had cancelled above deed of Power of Attorney vide registered deed No.6749 on 11-12-2016. But the learned Special Judge failed to appreciate above materials on record properly and committed serious illegality in framing charge against the petitioner under above provision of the Penal Code which is not tenable in law.

6. Mr Omar Faruk, learned Advocate for the Anti-corruption Commission submits that on consideration of the averments made in the FIR, charge-sheet and other materials on record the learned Special Judge has rightly framed charge against the petitioner which calls for no interference by this Court.

7. We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for the respective party and carefully examined all materials on record.

8. It is not disputed that now deceased Lokman Hasan Chowdhury made the petitioners his constituted attorney for 5.9 acres of land appertaining to seven plots by executing and registering a deed of power of attorney on 27th October, 2010.

9. It has been alleged by the learned Advocate for Anti-Corruption Commission that 2.7 acres land of plot No.5919 out of above 5.9 acres belonged to the Government and inclusion of above Government land in the above deed of attorney has made the deed a forged one. It is not understandable as to how mere inclusion of above one plot of Government land out of 7 plots in above deed of power of attorney makes the deed a forged one.

10. In his report the Investigation Officer stated that above Lokman Hasan Chowdhury has died during investigation of the case and before his death above Lokman Hassan Chowdhury cancelled the impugned deed of power of attorney deed by another registered deed being No.6749 on 11-12-2016.

11. There is no material on record to show that before above cancellation of the power of attorney deed or demise of the executant the petitioners performed any act in the form of owning, possessing or transferring of above land on the strength of the impugned deed of power of attorney.

12. It is well settled that a deed of power of attorney becomes void and inoperative as soon as the executant of the deed cancels the deed or the executant dies. A deed of power of attorney is not a deed of title. It is a mere delegation of authority by the maker of deed to the recipient of deed for performing certain acts on his behalf. This is an unilateral document and recipient of the deed has a little role in the creation of the document.

13. In above view of the materials on record we hold that the learned Special Judge failed to appreciate above materials on record properly and most illegally framed charge against the petitioners which is not tenable in the eye of law.

14. In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The impugned order No.27 dated 18-1-2022, passed by the learned Divisional Special Judge, Chattogram, in Special Case No.43 of 2018 arising out Sitakunda Police Station Case No.31 dated 24-3-2016 corresponding to GR No.108 of 2016 is hereby set-aside.
Communicate this judgment and order to the Court concerned at once.

Judgment
KM Hafizul Alam, J:

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 19-10-2016 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 6th Court, Chattogram in Sessions Case No.455 of 2012, arising out of Chandanaish Police Station Case No.6 dated 5-1-2012 corresponding to GR No. 6 of 2012 convicting the appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Taka 20,000 in default to suffer simple imprisonment for 2(two) years.

2. Prosecution case:
Facts, relevant for the purpose of disposal of the appeal, in short, are that one Sree Bivuti Ranjan Nath as informant lodged a First Information Report (in brief, the FIR) with Chandonaish Police Station against the convict-appellant. Accordingly the Chandonaish Police Station started Chandonaish Police Station Case No. 6 dated 5-1-2012 under section 302 of the Penal Code. The allegation was that the appellant and the deceased got married about 7 years back and they have a 6 years old son. The appellant frequently used to torture his wife mentally and physically from long time. For that reason there was a Salish Baithak by the local mayor and councilor and lastly on 3-1-2012 the local councillor asked them to settle the dispute amicably within 3 days but on 4-1-2012 at night the convict-appellant after returning home killed her wife by way of strangulation due to previous grudge.

3. Investigation and framing of charge:
Thereafter the investigating officer after investigation submitted a charge-sheet on 8-3-2012 against the convict-appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code. Subsequently the learned Sessions Judge framed charge against the convict-appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code on 31-5-2012 and the said case was transferred for holding trial to the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 6th Court, Chattogram.

4. Examination of witnesses:
At the time of trial the prosecution examined 15(fifteen) witnesses but the convict-appellant examined none as defense witness. After examination of the witnesses, the accused was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (in brief the CrPC) and he pleaded himself as not guilty as well as he denied the allegations made against him. He also sought for justice and refused to give any witness.

5. Judgment: Conviction and Sentence:

Thereafter the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 6th Court, Chattogram considering the evidences and materials on record vide judgment and order dated 19-10-2016 convicted and sentenced the appellant as stated above.

6. Appeal before the High Court Division:
The convict-appellant being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 19-10-2016 preferred this appeal before this Hon'ble High Court Division and the appeal was admitted on 3-4-2017 and he was enlarged on bail 4-12-2018.

7. Submissions: for the Appellant:
At the time of hearing of appeal, Mr Abdus Salam Mamun, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the convict-appellant submits that there is no eye witnesses of the occurrence and even the impartial and disinterested witnesses were declared tendered and the PWs contradicted with each other moreover non examination of disinterested important neighboring witnesses caused serious doubt in the prosecution story as such the learned court below ought to have acquitted the appellant by giving benefit of doubt.

 
7.1 Mr Mamun next submits that the appellant has not committed any offence as alleged and that on the date of occurrence after returning home at night when he opened the door he found the dead body of his wife hanging on ceiling with fan and he immediately informed the matter to his parents-in-law and the landlord of his rented house.

 
7.2 He further submits that after getting information police came to the place of occurrence and he along with his father-in-law and local mayor went to the police station with dead body where the mayor mislead his father-in-law and took his signature in the FIR and got the appellant arrested.


7.3 He next submits that in order to give confessional statement the police at the instance of the Mayor mercilessly beat him and he lost sense and when he regain sense they threatened him and tortured by a pliers and screw driver pressing his finger, gave electric shock, pushed hot egg into the rectum and pour down hot water on the face threatening him of cross fire by RAB if he does not give a confessional statement in their version and under such a compelling circumstances he made a confessional statement to save his life as was written by police as such the confessional statement was neither true nor voluntary.


7.4 He also submits that in the confessional statement the appellant stated that her wife kept their only son to her parents' house against his will and due to that he had quarrel with his wife; that she was disobedient to him and would go to her father's house without informing him every now and then and she would stay there for 5/6 days for last several months; that she started to take injection for permanent birth control beyond his knowledge; that there were several family salish; that on 4-1-2012 while he was in the shop she went out without informing him and came back; that at night after returning home from pharmacy while he asked for rice but she misbehaved with him using filthy language instead of giving rice and he being angry gave a slap and in return she gave two kicks and called him by bad names throwing sandal to him and at that stage he lost his mental balance and throated his wife to which she died and then he informed his landlord Liton Barua and after getting information from Commissioner police went to the place of occurrence and arrested him.


7.5 Mr Mamun further submits that PW 3 informant in his cross examination on re-call stated that the character of the convict-appellant was highly appreciable and he did not give dowry at the time of marriage and there is a child of the couple who now spending time uncared of and he did not see the convict-appellant torturing his daughter.


7.6 He submits that the appellant has already served about 7 years since 5-1-2012 to 4-12-2018 and his only son is being grown up uncared in absence of parents.


7.7 He next submits that PW 4 is the mother-in-law of the appellant who deposed that the appellant was a boy of good character and religious minded and that the accused never demanded dowry and did not torture her daughter but the Mayor has taken signature of her husband in the FIR and got the appellant tortured by the police.


7.8 Mr Mamun also submits that PW 5 Md Abu Toyob deposed that he did not see the occurrence; PW 6 Md Helal Uddin deposed that while police arrived at house of the accused, the accused-appellant was there in the home and he did not see the occurrence and in police custody the accused was beaten at the instance of the Mayor and he heard that somebody has killed the deceased Lovely before Jogdish arrived home; PW 7 Helal Uddin Chowdhury deposed that on 4-1-2012 at about 2-30 pm Jogodish got him awaked and said that his wife Lovely died and her body was lying on the floor and further stated that the deposition he gave on 11-9-2013 was tutored by Public Prosecutor.


7.9 Mr Mamun lastly submits that as there is no eye witness, therefore, the learned court below mainly relying upon the confessional statement of the appellant convicted him but for the sake of argument even if the statement is considered true but that cannot be basis for conviction under section 302 of the Penal Code because the confessional statement itself speaks that due to the sudden quarrel the appellant being provoked by his wife hit of moment without having any motive he caught the throat of his wife and unfortunately she died as such if the appellant is found guilty at best he be convicted under section 304(II) of the Penal Code.

8. Submission: for the Prosecution Ms Samira Tarannum Rabeya, learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the respondent State, submits that the prosecution has examined 15 (fifteen) witnesses and the said witnesses have corroborated with each other to prove the case against the convict-appellant. She next submits that the appellant has made confessional statement in which he elaborately stated how and under what circumstances he killed his wife, therefore, the prosecution case has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt against the convict-appellant.
8.1 She lastly submits that the learned trial judge upon considering the documents on records and testimonies of PWs and evidences rightly convicted the convict-appellant as such the appeal may kindly be dismissed.

9. We have meticulously examined the FIR, charge-sheet, depositions of the witnesses, the judgment and order of the trial court, and the memo of appeal as well as the relevant laws. We have also heard the learned Advocate Mr Md Abdus Salam Mamun for the appellant and the learned Deputy Attorney-General for the State at length and considered their submissions.

10. Points for determination:


In this context we need to determine the following issues:

1. Whether the prosecution has been able to prove the allegation of murder against the appellant; and

2. Whether in absence of any eye witness as to the killing of the deceased, the conviction only on the basis of confession is sustainable in law.


10.1 Now let us examine how far the above allegations have been proved by the evidences given by the prosecution witnesses.

11. Discussions and Analysis of evidence:
On perusal of the evidences it appears that the appellant got married to the deceased Lovely and they have a child. On the day of occurrence the dead body of the deceased Lovely was found at the rented house of the appellant. There is no eye-witness to the occurrence of death of the deceased. PW 3, father of the deceased being informed by the appellant went to the place of occurrence and the police took the dead body to the police station. After that PW 3 lodged the FIR against the appellant for causing death to the deceased. He in his deposition stated that the appellant killed his daughter Lovely but he in his cross examination on re-call stated that the character of the convict-appellant was highly appreciable and he did not give dowry at the time of marriage and there is a child of the couple who now spending time uncared of He did not see the convict-appellant torturing his daughter and he did not see strangulation of his daughter by the accused. Even PW 4, mother-in-law of the appellant deposed that the appellant was a boy of good character and religious minded and that the accused never demanded dowry and did not torture her daughter. The Mayor has taken signature of her husband in the FIR and got the appellant tortured by the police. PW 5 Md Abu Toyob deposed that he did not see the occurrence; PW 6 Md Helal Uddin deposed that while police arrived at the house of the accused, the appellant was there in the home and before their arrival police was in the house of the accused and that he did not see the occurrence and in police custody the accused was beaten at the instance of the Mayor and he heard that somebody has killed the deceased Lovely before the arrival of Jogdish at home; PW 7 Helal Uddin Chowdhury deposed that on 4-1-2012 at about 2-30 pm Jogodish got him awaked and said that his wife Lovely died and her body is on the floor and called on the police and stated further that his deposition dated 11-9-2013 was tutored by Public Prosecutor. PW 8, 9 and 11 having heard the incident first went to the place of occurrence but they have been tendered by the prosecution.

12. Findings and Reasoning:
From the discussions made above it appears that that there is no eye witness to the occurrence but there is a confessional statement of this appellant. Though in chief PW 3 father and PW 4 Mother of the deceased suspected the appellant in killing their daughter but in cross examination, on recall, they completely took different stand and stated that the appellant is a man of good character having good relation with his wife and he is not involved with the alleged occurrence. It is admitted that the victim was found dead in the house of the appellant. Moreover the post mortem report shows that she was killed and the nature of death was homicidal in nature and ante mortem. In the criminal case though the burden absolutely lies upon the prosecution but when the wife is killed in the custody of husband then section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872 mandates that the accused has to explain the situation under which circumstance the wife was killed. The section reads as follows :

106.

Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge—When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.
Illustrations (a) When a person does an act with some intention other than that which the character and circumstances of the act suggest, the burden of proving that intention is upon him. (b) A is charged with travelling on a train without a ticket. The burden of proving that he had a ticket is on him.
13.

Regarding the burden in these circum-stances, in the case of State vs Md Abul Kalam Azad reported in 8 BLC 464 it has been held that—
The law is now well settled that when the wife is found dead in the house of her husband, the court requires the husband or other members of his family living with her to explain the circumstances in which she died.
14.

In the case of Abul Kalam Mollah vs State reported in 51 DLR 544 it has been held that— "Ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he was placed on trial, but the murder having taken place while the accused was living with his deceased wife in the same house, he was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death."
15.

In the case of Abdul Motaleb Howlader vs State reported in 6 BLC (AD) 1 it has been held that— "It is well settled that ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial. The murder having taken place while the condemned-prisoner was living with his wife in the same-house he was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. In the absence of any explanation coming from, his side it seems none other than the husband was responsible for causing death in question."
16.

In this situation the Honourable Appellate Division in the case of alias Hussain vs State reported in 54 DLR (AD) 78 held that—
It is well settled that when a wife met with an unnatural death while in custody of the husband and also while in his house the husband is to explain under what circumstance the wife met with her death.
17. In the instant case in the confessional statement the appellant admitted that he killed his wife. Though the appellant claimed that he was mercilessly beaten and by putting him on fear of cross fire by RAB he was compelled to give the confessional statement prepared by the police and the said statement was not voluntary and true. But from the materials on records it appears that the appellant has not filed any application for retraction of the confessional statement at any stage of trial. He further claimed that the deceased's previous partner of immoral act might have killed her but he could not establish this case by adducing any witnesses. In the said confessional statement he stated that her wife kept their only son to her parents' house against his will and due to that he had quarrel with his wife; that she was disobedient to him and would go to her father's house without informing him every now and then and she would stay there for 5/6 days for last several months; that she started to take injection for permanent birth control beyond his knowledge; that there were several family salish; that on 4-1-2012 while he was in the shop she went out without informing him and came back; that at night after returning home from pharmacy while he asked for rice she misbehaved with him using filthy language instead of giving rice and he being angry gave a slap and in return she gave two kicks and called him by bad names throwing sandal to him and at that stage he lost his mental balance and throated his wife to which she died and then he informed his land lord Liton Barua. Thereafter police went there getting information from Commissioner and arrested him. Even at the time of hearing of appeal, the learned Advocate for the appellant submits that being provoked by the deceased, she and the appellant got into altercation and suddenly out of passion without having any intention caught the throat of the deceased but unfortunately she died by suffocation, therefore, the offence falls under exception 4 of the section 300 of the Penal Code as such his conviction may kindly be altered to section 304(II) of the Penal Code and as he has already served out substantial part of sentence in custody hence by committing the sentence he be released from the custody.

18. In view of the above if we consider the circumstances of the incident, confessional statement of the appellant and failure of the appellant to discharge his burden to explain the circumstance of killing the deceased, we find that the confessional statements appear to be true and voluntary and the explanation is natural and believable. In this back drop it is apparent that on the black night as usual the appellant came back home from his pharmacy and he asked his wife for providing him rice but she misbehaved with him using filthy language instead of giving him rice. Out of anger and being suddenly proved he slapped her and in return she gave two kicks and called him by bad names throwing sandal to him and at that stage he lost his mental balance and without having any previous motive to kill her wife he throated his wife to which unfortunately she died due to suffocation.

19. In view of the above we find that the alleged offence falls under the exception 4 of the section 300 of the Penal Code.

20. The exception of 4 of section 300 for ready reference is reproduced as below:
Exception 4. -Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
Explanation. -It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.

21.

In the case of State vs Tayeb Ali and others reported in 40 DLR (AD) 6 it has been held that— "All murders are culpable homicides but all culpable homicides are not murder. Excepting the General Exceptions attached to the definition of murder an act committed either with certain guilty intention or with certain guilty knowledge constitutes culpable homicide amounting to murder. If the criminal act is done with the intention of causing death then it is murder clear and simple. If death is likely to result from the injuries it is culpable homicide not amounting to murder; and if death is the most likely result, then it is murder."
22.

In the case of The State represented by Solicitor vs Ashraf Ali & others reported in 1994 BLD (AD) 127 it has been held that— "Mere killing of a person or mere causing of a person's death is not Murder, Culpable Homicide or even any other criminal offence; but it is so when caused with certain guilty intention or guilty knowledge. Three classes of cases have been described in sec. 299 as "Culpable Homicide" and four classes of cases have been described in sec. 300 as "Murder". -The difference between mere "Culpable Homicide" and "Culpable Homicide amounting to Murder" amounting to is the degree of probability of death being caused. When death is probable, it is Culpable Homicide; but when death is most probable then, it is Murder."
23.

In the case of The State vs Montu reported in 44 DLR (AD) 287 it has been held that— "But these injuries, though caused intentionally, are of such a nature that these are "likely to cause death". We do not think that this criminal act of causing the death falls into any of the four categories of criminal acts which constitute 'murder' as described in section 300 of the Penal Code. We rather find that this criminal act was done with the intention of causing such injuries as are likely to cause death, as described in section 299. As such, it constitutes culpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable under section 304 Part I of the Penal Code."
24. In the case of State vs Abdul Khaleque reported in 46 DLR 353 it has been held that- "As there is a possibility that before the occurrence there might have been some sort of altercation between the accused and the deceased or loss of temper by the accused, it cannot be held that it was a premeditated murder."

25.

In the case of Abul Kalam Azad vs State reported in 1994 BLD 401 = 47 DLR 317 it has been held that— "It is clear from the evidence that the free fight between the parties took place after an altercation from cutting of branches of trees by the deceased. The learned Sessions Judge on consideration of the evidence and the fact and circumstances of the case found that the death of Abdul Wadud was caused without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offenders having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner and this attracts exception 4 to section 300 of the Penal Code. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record, we find that the learned Sessions Judge rightly found the attraction of Exception 4 to section 300 of the Penal Code to this case."
26.

In the case of Mom in Malitha vs State reported in 41 DLR 37 it has been held that— "From the evidence on record, it transpires that there was quarrel and golmal over the fencing on the disputed land and also altercation took place on the day of occurrence between the parties over removal of the fencing which ultimately culminated into a "maramari" causing thereby bleeding injury on the person of the appellant's son Kalu in one hand and the death of the victim Abdul Karim on the other. Besides, the injury on the person of the son of accused Momin Malitha could not be explained away by the prosecution. It also appears that the accused had no undue advantage in the matter. Be that as it may, on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record and also the relevant provisions of law, we are of the view that the alleged offence committed by this appellant Momin Malitha comes within the ambit of the Exceptions I and 4 of Section 300 of the Penal Code and, as such, this appellant cannot be convicted and sentenced under Section 302 of the Penal Code."
27. In view of the above discussions and the facts and circumstances of the case, and the legal proposition it can safely be said that the allegation brought against the appellant has been proved beyond reasonable doubt and the convict-appellant is guilty for commission of offence under section 304-11 of the Penal Code. Therefore, for the ends of justice his conviction for imprisonment of life under section 302 of the Penal Code is altered under section 304-11 of the Penal Code and the appellant be sentenced thereunder for the period which he has already served out in the jail custody.

28. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with modification of sentence of imprisonment as stated above.

29. Bail bond furnished by the appellant namely Jagadish Devnath son of late Rai Mohan Devnath in connection with this appeal stands discharged.
The office is directed to send down the lower court's record (LCR) along with a copy of this judgment and order to the concerned court below at once.

<p>Accordingly, the application is allowed.</p>

<p>4. Mr Md Khurshid Alain Khan, learned Advocate filed an affidavit-in-fact on 5-3-2019 and a supplementary affidavit-in-facts on 9-4-2019 on behalf respondent No.1 wherein it is stated that the accused Md Abu Salek (absconding) opened a bank account being Current Account No. 001020974 in the Sonali Bank Limited, Mirpur Cantonment Branch, Dhaka on 8-2-2010. Mr Moinul Hoque, supporting Sub
<br />Assisting staff assisted him for opening the said bank account. Mr Shahidul Islam was the introducer of the said bank account and Mr Moinul introduced the accused as his cousin. That the said account was opened in the name of `Mobile Mela' and in the account opening form he used the said business institution address which is: 10/A, Road No. 6, Plot No. 1, Mirpur, Dhaka but after investigation it was identified that the said institution 'Mobile Mela' was not in the said address. However, in the account opening form the accused Md Abu Salek (absconding) was mentioned his present address which is: TA Monjil, 11/6 Harunabad, Mirpur, Dhaka but later it was identified as fake address. Between 16-2-2010 and 26-8-2010, the accused misappropriated Taka 18,47,20,000 by using 33 branches of 18 Banks and 106 Cheques. The Deputy Managing Director (DGM), Bangladesh Bank, Head Office, Dhaka sent a letter to the Director-General, special enquiry and investigation, Durnity Daman Commission, Dhaka on 30-6-2011 regarding to take necessary steps for misappropriation Taka 18,47,20,000 from the Sonali Bank Limited, Mirpur Cantonment Branch, Dhaka. The said forgery was occurred for the mismanagement of “নিকাশ ঘর” at the Sonali Bank, Mirpur Branch, Dhaka and the following persons were involved for doing the said forgery which are 1. Md Abu Salak, 2. Babul Mia, 3. Md Nour Alam. After opening the said bank account in the Sonali Bank Limited, Mirpur Cantonment Branch, Dhaka; the fraud circle opened several bank accounts in the 33 branches of the 18 banks and deposited the issued cheques which were issued by the Sonali Bank Limited Mirpur Cantonment Branch, Dhaka. Thereafter the local branch of the Sonali Bank Limited did not submit the said cheques to the Mirpur Cantonment Branch through the Dhaka clearing house and tempering the main clearing voucher and submitted fraud cheques to the Mirpur Contentment Branch for clearing. Thereafter the said cheques amounts were withdrawn and misappropriated the said amounts.</p>

<p>5. It is further stated that the procedure for clearing the cheque was not followed at the time of commission of offence. The procedure for clearing the cheque was as follows:
<br />
&nbsp; They have opened several account in Sonali Bank Limited, Mirpur Cantonment Branch in the name of Abu Salek and at the same time they have opened several account in different other 33 Branches of 18 Banks and issued cheques of Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch to be deposited in those other bank accounts; the account holders deposited the said cheques in their respective accounts. As per Rules, the Bank sends those cheques to the clearing house of Bangladesh Bank and Bangladesh Bank forwarded the said cheques to Sonali Bank local Branches. The local branches prepared three copies of voucher (TRA form) by using carbon paper (White, Red and Green) mentioning the description of all cheques to be sent to Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch. Thereafter, the clearing representative supporting sub-staff of Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch will receive the cheques with two copies of voucher (Red and Green) along with computer printed list of those cheques and amount by signing in White voucher and depositing the same in local branch. As per Rules, the branch representative will deposit those chaques and computer printed list in his branch and the concern officers of branch after proper scrutiny, will sign and seal in the vouchers and cheques and return the Red voucher to the local branch through same representative and will preserve the Green voucher in the branch. But in this case the fake cheques and two (Red and Green) vouchers were taken down and new vouchers and computer cheque list were prepared with valid cheques and replaced the earlier vouchers and computer cheque list; thereafter the same was deposited to the Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch. As those cheques were legal, the branch officers allowed the cheques and send the Red voucher to the local branch through clearing representative. But the original Red Voucher was not deposited but by false and fabricating the sign and seal of the Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch, the earlier Red voucher was deposited to local branch for clearing. The concern officer of the local branch without examining the sign and seal of the Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch in Red voucher forwarded all the money to clearing house and as the same was consistent with the White voucher, the money was deposited to the concern Bank account. Hence no money was debited from the account of Abu Salek but the cheque amount was deposited to other account, which was never been in the account of Abu Salek and the same was misappropriated.</p>

<p>6. It is also stated that the accused mentioned his permanent address in the bank account opening form which is Salimabad Union, Nagarpur, Tangail. The Bank officer and the account introducer were confirmed from the image that the Jahalam was managing the said accounts. Noor Banu was the nominee of the accused's account No.001020974 of the Sonali Bank Limited, Mirpur Cantonment Branch, Dhaka mentioned her address: Salimabad Union, Nagarpur, Tangail. After enquiry Bangladesh Bank and Sonali Bank were given investigation reports where the accused's address is Salimabad Union, Nagarpur, Tangail. On 18-12-2014 in the presence of the investigation officer the bank officers/bank account introducer were identified Mr Jahalam as Mr Abu Salek. The following bank officers/bank account introducer are as follows: (1) Mr Foysal Kayes, Senior Principal Officer, Asad Gate Branch, BRAC Bank, Mohammadpur SME Branch, Dhaka; (2) Mrs. Sabina Sharmin, Ex Branch Manager, BRAC Bank, Mohammadpur SME Branch, Dhaka; (3) Mr Md Shahidul Islam, Son of Md Younus Mia, At present-9 Parimal Vila, 3rd Sattar Molla Road, Mirpur-12, Pallabi, Dhaka and Village and Post Office-Binodpur, Police Station-Noakhali Sadar, District-Noakhali; (4) Mr Md Nuruddin Sheikh, Senior Executive Officer, Sonali Bank Ltd., Inspection and Audit Division-1, Dhaka; (5) Mr Md Shakil, Son of Haji Md Nurul Hague Bepari of Nana Shaympur, Dhaka-1400 and Permanent Address-Village and Post Office-Mirershorai, Police Station and District-Munshigonj; (6) Mrs. Tajbin Sultana, Office (Cash), United Commercial Bank Ltd.

However, Mr Azhaul Islam Montu, Chairman of Salimabad Union Parishad, Nagarpur, Tangail and Mr Safiqur Rahman, Chairman of Duvuria Union Parishad, Nagarpur, Tangail were also identified the Jahalam as Abu Salek. The report of the Bangladesh Bank and the Sonali Bank Ltd. it appears that there were serious mismanagement in the concerned Bank authorities but no departmental action has yet been taken against the persons who were responsible.</p>

<p>7. It is further stated that between 2-2-2018 and 23-2-2018 in the Channel 24 'Search Light' program, a report was broadcasted regarding the Durnity Daman cases of Sonali Bank Ltd., Mirpur Cantonment branches, Dhaka.

<p>10. It is stated that section 31 of the Dumity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 deals with savings and indemnity of Acts done in good faith. Section 31 of the Ain, runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-family: &quot;Noto Sans Bengali&quot;, sans-serif; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">

</blockquote>

<p>11. That the section 31 provides that a person who is affected or is likely to be affected by any act done

&nbsp; or purported to have been done in good faith while performing duties under this Act or under the rules framed thereunder or order shall not be entitled to bring any civil suit or criminal case or any legal proceedings against the Commission, any Commissioner or any officer or employee of the Commission and, as such, it is difficult to say that the mistake has been done with a mala fide' act of the investigating officer. Because the investigation based on Banks documents i.e. Bangladesh Bank Ltd., Head Office, Dhaka, Sonali Bank Ltd., Head Office, Dhaka, Agrani Bank Ltd., Head Office, Dhaka, BRAC Bank Ltd.,  Head Office, Dhaka, United Commercial Bank Ltd., Head Office, Dhaka and City Bank Ltd., Head Office, Dhaka. The section 545 of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with the power of Court to pay expenses or compensation out of fine. Section 545 of the Code of Criminal Procedure runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
&nbsp; "545. (1) Whenever under any law in force for the time being a Criminal Court imposes a fine or confirms in appeal, revision or otherwise a sentence of fine, or a sentence of which fine forms a part, the Court may, when passing judgment, order the whole or any part of the fine recovered to be applied –
<br />(a) in defraying expenses properly incurred in the prosecution;
<br />
&nbsp; (b) in. the payment to any person of compensation for any loss or injury caused by the offence, when substantial compensation is, in the opinion of the Court, recoverable by such person in a Civil Court;
<br />
&nbsp; (c) when any person is convicted of any offence which includes theft, criminal misappropriation, criminal breach of trust, or cheating, or of having dishonestly received or retained, or of having voluntarily assisted in disposing of, stolen property knowing or having reason to believe the same to be stolen, MMn compensating any bonafide purchaser, of such property for the loss of the same if such property is restored to the possession of the person entitled thereto.
<br />
&nbsp; (2) If the fine is imposed in a case which is subject to appeal, no such payment shall be made before the period allowed for presenting the appeal has elapsed, or, if an appeal be presented, before the decision of the appeal."
</blockquote>

<p>12. In view of the specific provision mentioned above, i.e., section 545 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is a provision for compensation on conclusion of the trial after realizing of fine and, as such, in view of the alternative remedy question of prejudice does not arise at all. Considering the above facts and circumstances and section 31 of the Durnity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 and 545 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this Hon'ble Court may kindly exonerated the Durnity Daman Commission
from the charge of compensation.</p>

<p>13. Thereafter, an affidavit-in-compliance dated 11-7-2019 filed on behalf of the respondent `.\Io.1 wherein it is stated that Jaha Alam spent behind bars, arrested in connection with 26 cases that were filed against him wrongfully and Abu Salek, the fraudster who managed to pull the wool over the investigation agencies' eyes simply by substituting Jahaalam's address in place of Abu Salek on documents which were used in the execution of his fraudulent activities. There was an enquiry committee at the instance of the Durnity Daman Commission headed by Mr Abul Hasnat Md Abdul Wadud, (District and Sessions Judge)

&nbsp; and Director (Legal), Durnity Daman Commission, Head Office, Dhaka with a direction to submit his report within 21 days being Memo No.00.01.0000.103.39.063.07 (Ask-8)-4065(6) dated 5-2-2019.

রেজিস্ট্রেশন সংক্রান্ত তথ্যাদি বিটিআরসি হতে সংগ্রহ করেন। বিটিআরসি হতে প্রাপ্ত তথ্য পর্যালোচনায় দেখায় যে, ০১৭৪৯৬৮৫০৫১ নম্বরটি মোঃ আবুসালেক নামে রেজিস্ট্রেশনকৃত। রেজিস্ট্রেশনকালে দাখিলকৃত জাতীয়

না জিজ্ঞেস করলে মঈনুল হক জানান যে, ব্যাংকের লোকের সই দেয়ার বিধান নেই। তিনি মঈনুল হক এর কথায় সরল বিশ্বাসে পরিচয়দানকারী হিসাবে স্বাক্ষর করেন।   <br />   <br />উল্লিখিত প্রেক্ষাপটে তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তা সহকারী পরিচালক সেলিনা আক্তার মনি ব্র্যাক ব্যাংক লিঃ, মোহাম্মদপুর এস এম ই শাখায় মেহেরুন সামাদ ট্রেডার্স প্রোঃ গোলাম মর্তুজা নামীয় হিসাবে Introducer ও উক্ত ব্যাংকের অফিসার জনাব মোঃ ফয়সাল কায়েসকে গ্রাহকের অস্তিত্ব খুজে বের করে দেয়ার জন্য চাপ দিলে তিনি প্রথমে উক্ত হিসাবে ব্যবহৃত গোলাম মর্তুজার শ্যামলীর ঠিকানায় যান। সেখানে কেয়ারটেকার গোলাম মর্তুজার ছবি দেখে তাকে জানান যে, ছবির লোক অনেক আগে উক্ত ঠিকানায় থাকতো এবং টাঙ্গাইলের আঞ্চলিক ভাষায় কথা বলতো। এর পর তিনি তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তার নিকট হতে একই ছবি ব্যবহার করে সোনালী ব্যাংকে খোলা হিসাবে ব্যবহৃত নাগরপুরের ঠিকানা সংগ্রহপূর্বক অনুসন্ধানের জন্য ছবিসহ নাগরপুর উপজেলার সলিমাবাদ ইউনিয়নের গয়নাপাড়া বাজারে যান। উক্ত বাজারের কয়েকজন লোক উক্ত ছবি দেখে তাকে জাহালম ওরফে জানে আলম, ইউসুফ আলী হিসাবে সনাক্ত করে এবং সে বর্তমানে ঘোড়াশালে জুটমিলে কাজ করে মর্মে জানায়। এছাড়াও পার্শ্ববর্তী ধুবুড়িয়া বাজারে জাহালমের ভাই শাহনুরের ইলেকট্রিক মালামালের দোকান আছে মর্মে তাকে জানানো হলে তিনি শাহানুরের দোকানে গিয়ে জাহালমের ঘোড়াশালের ঠিকানা সংগ্রহ করেন। পরবর্তীতে তিনি দুদক কর্মকর্তা ও তার ব্যাংকের উর্ধ্বতন কর্মকর্তা সাবিনা (যিনি গোলাম মর্তুজা নামীয় হিসাব অনুমোদন করেছিলেন) সহ ঘোড়াশাল জুটমিলে যান এবং জাহালমকে দেখে আবুসালেকের ছবির সাথে মিল থাকায় জাহালমকে আবুসালেক হিসাবে সনাক্ত করেন এবং বিষয়টি তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তা ও সহকারী পরিচালক সেলিনা আক্তার মনিকে জানান। পরবর্তীতে তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাগণের নোটিশের প্রেক্ষিতে জাহালম দুদক কার্যালয়ে উপস্থিত হলে দুদক মিডিয়া সেন্টারে তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাগণ জাহালমকে বিভিন্ন ব্যাংকে একই ছবি ব্যবহার করে বিভিন্ন নামে খোলা ব্যাংক হিসাবের পরিচয়দানকারী/অনুমোদনকারী কর্মকর্তাগণকে মুখোমুখী করেন। জনাব জাহালমকে সামনা সামনি দেখে ব্র্যাক ব্যাংক লিঃ, মোহাম্মদপুর এস এম ই শাখার মেহেরুন সামাদ ট্রেডার্স নামীয় হিসাবের পরিচয়দানকারী জনাব মোঃ ফয়সাল কায়েস, অফিসার, ব্র্যাক ব্যাংক লিঃ (২) উক্ত মেহেরুন সামাদ ট্রেডার্স নামীয় হিসাবের

ব্যাংক হিসাব খোলার জন্য বিভিন্ন ব্যাংকে গিয়েছিলেন মর্মে নিশ্চিত করেন। এছাড়াও ইউসিবিএল, মোহাম্মদপুর শাখার সালেক ট্রেডার্স নামীয় চলতি হিসাব নাম্বার ০০৫০১১১০০০২৯৭০৮ এর পরিচয়দানকারী মিসেস তাজিবন সুলতানা অফিসার (ক্যাশ) উক্ত ব্যাংক জাহালমের ছবি দেখে ছবির ব্যক্তি তার ব্যাংকে সালেক ট্রেডার্স নামে উক্ত চলতি হিসাব খুলে ছিলেন মর্মে বক্তব্য প্রদান করেন। উল্লিখিত প্রেক্ষাপটে যে কয়টি মামলায় ইতোপূর্বে চার্জশীট দাখিল করা হয়েছিল যে কয়টি বাদে অন্য সকল মামলায় তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাগণ আসামী আবুসালেকের পরিবর্তে জাহালমের বিরুদ্ধে চার্জশীট দাখিলের সুপারিশ করেন এবং তদানুযায়ী চার্জশীট দাখিল করা হয়।   <br />   <br />সার্বিক পর্যালোচনায় প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, জনাব সেলিনা আক্তার মনি, বর্তমানে উপ-পরিচালক মূল তদন্ত কাজ করেছেন এবং অন্যান্য তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাগণ তাকে অনুসরণ করেছেন। রেকর্ডপত্র অনুযায়ী জনাব সেলিনা আক্তার মনি, বর্তমানে উপ-পরিচালক ২টি, জনাব সুমিত্রা সেন, সহকারী পরিচালক ২টি, জনাব মোঃ মাসুদুর রহমান, বর্তমানে উপ-পরিচালক ২টি, জনাব সিলভিয়া ফেরদৌস, বর্তমানে সহকারী পরিচালক ৩টি, জনাব মফতাউল জান্নাত, বর্তমানে

এবং তদানুযায়ী জনাব মোঃ জাহালমের বিরুদ্ধে চার্জশীট দাখিলের অনুমোদন জ্ঞাপন করা হয় এবং চার্জশীট দাখিল করা হয়।   <br />   <br /><strong>(খ) আলোচ্য মামলা সমূহের অনুসন্ধান ও তদন্তে ত্রুটি বিচ্যুতি উদ্ঘাটন এবং সংশ্লিষ্টদের দায়-দায়িত্ব নিরূপন:</strong>   <br />অনুসন্ধানকালে সংঘটিত ত্রুটি বিচ্যুতি:   <br />১. সোনালী ব্যাংক লিঃ, মিরপুর ক্যান্টনমেন্ট শাখা, ঢাকায় সংঘটিত জালিয়াতির মাধ্যমে অর্থ আত্মসাতের বিষয়ে ব্যবস্থা গ্রহণের জন্য বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক হতে মহাপরিচালক (বিশেষ অনুসন্ধান ও তদন্ত), দুর্নীতি দমন কমিশনকে পত্র দেয়া হয়। উক্ত পত্রে প্রতারক চক্র সোনালী ব্যাংক লিঃ, মিরপুর ক্যান্টনমেন্ট শাখায় হিসাব খোলার সাথে সাথে অন্যান্য আরও ১৮ টি ব্যাংকের ৩৩টি শাখায় হিসাব খোলা এবং উক্ত হিসাবের মাধ্যমে ভুয়া ক্লিয়ারিং ভাউচার ব্যবহার করে মোট ১৮ কোটি ৪৭,৩৫,০০০ টাকা আত্মসাতের তথ্য প্রদান করা হয়। অর্থাৎ অভিযোগটি ব্যাপক প্রকৃতির। অভিযোগ সংশ্লিষ্ট রেকর্ডপত্রের পরিমান বিপুল এবং সম্পৃক্ত ব্যক্তিবর্গের সংখ্যাও অনেক বেশি। এখানে কোন অনসন্ধান দল গঠন না করে একজন মাত্র অনুসন্ধানকারী কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ করা হয়েছে। অনুসন্ধানকারী কর্মকর্তাও বিষয়টি নিশ্চিতভাবে কমিশনের নজরে আনেননি।   <br />   <br />২. গত ২৬-১২-২০১০ খ্রিঃ তারিখে জনাব আব্দুল্লাহ-আল-জাহিদকে অনুসন্ধানকারী কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ করা হন। তিনি ২৮-১২-২০১০ খ্রিঃ তারিখে সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যাংক হিসাবসমূহ Freeze করার জন্য বিজ্ঞ মহানগর সিনিয়র স্পেশাল জজ আদালত, ঢাকায় আবেদন করেন এবং ৪-১-২০১১ খ্রিঃ তারিখে Freeze Order প্রাপ্ত হন এবং এ বিষয়ে একটি প্রতিবেদন দাখিল করেন। কমিশন হতে ২৭-২-২০১১ খ্রিঃ তারিখে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক কর্তৃক গঠিত পরিদর্শন টিমের পরিদর্শন নিয়ে প্রতিবেদন সংগ্রহ ও পর্যালোচনাপূর্বক অনুসন্ধান প্রতিবেদন দাখিলের জন্য নির্দেশ প্রদান করা হয়। এ প্রেক্ষিতে তিনি গত ৯-৫-২০১১ খ্রিঃ তারিখে প্রতিবেদন দাখিল করেন। উক্ত প্রতিবেদনের ৭ নং দফায় তিনি উল্লেখ করেন যে, “আলোচ্য বিষয়ে সোনালী ব্যাংক লিঃ, স্থানীয় খান বাদী হয়ে মতিঝিল থানায় মামলা নং ২৩ তারিখ ১৪-৯-২০১০ খ্রিঃ ধারা: দণ্ড বিধি ৪০৬/৪২০) রুজু করেছেন। বর্তমানে পুলিশ বিভাগ উক্ত মামলায় অতিরিক্ত সংযোজনের জন্য বিজ্ঞ মহানগর হাকিম আদালত নং ১৮-এ আবেদন করেছেন বলে বিজ্ঞ আদালত সূত্রে জানা গেছে। উল্লেখ্য, ফৌজদারী কার্যবিধির ১৫৪ ধারা এবং এতদসংক্রান্ত উচ্চ আদালতের নজির পর্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় যে, একই ঘটনায় একাধিক এফ আই আর রুজু করা আইনসম্মত নয়।” আলোচ্য অভিযোগ সংশ্লিষ্ট নথি নং- দুদক/বিঃঅনুং ও তদ.-১/মানিলন্ডারিং ৫৫-২০১০ পর্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় উক্ত প্রতিবেদন দাখিলের পর অনুসন্ধানকারী কর্মকর্তার সাথে তৎকালীন মহাপরিচালক (বিঃ অনুঃ ও তদ.) কর্নেল হানিফ ইকবাল এর একাধিকবার আলোচনা হয় এবং পরবর্তীতে গত ২৩-২-২০১২ খ্রিঃ তারিখে তাকে পূর্ণাঙ্গ প্রতিবেদন দাখিলের জন্য নির্দেশ প্রদান করা হয়। এ প্রেক্ষিতে তিনি গত ৮-৩-২০১২ খ্রিঃ তারিখে ৩৩ টি মামলা রুজু সুপারিশ করে প্রতিবেদন দাখিল করেন এবং কমিশনের অনুমোদন-ক্রমে ৩৩ টি মামলা রুজু হয়। কিন্তু কেন অনুসন্ধানকারী একটি মামলায় স্থির না থেকে ৩৩ টি রিপোর্টে উল্লেখ নেই। তিনি পূর্বেই তার একটি রিপার্টে বলেছিলেন যে, একই ঘটনায় একাধিক এফ আই আর রুজু করা আইনসম্মত নয়। তাহলে এই “আইন সম্মত নয়” কাজটিই কেন তিনি পরবর্তীতে করলেন তার বিস্তারিত বিবরণ অবশ্যই তার রিপোর্টে থাকা উচিত ছিল। ১টি মামলার পরিবর্তে ৩৩টি মামলা দায়ের করা এবং মামলার ঘটনাস্থল পরিবর্তন করে ফেলা এগুলির সাথে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আইনগত প্রশ্ন জড়িত ছিল। অভিযোগটির অনুসন্ধানকারী কর্মকর্তা বা তদারককারী কর্মকর্তা বা সংশ্লিষ্ট মহাপরিচালক গ্রহণ করেনিন। লিগ্যাল অনুবিভাগের সাথে বিষয়টি নিয়ে আলোচনা করলে কিংবা লিগ্যাল অনুবিভাগ থেকে মতামত গ্রহণ করলে এই ভুলটি এড়ানো সম্ভব হত। এ ভুলের দায় ইও তদারককারী কিংবা সংশ্লিষ্ট মহাপরিচালক এড়াতে পারেন না।   <br />   <br />এজাহারে জাহালম নামে কাউকে আসামী করা হয়নি তবে মোঃ আবুসালেক, গ্রাম-গয়নাপাড়া, পোঃ-সলিমাবাদ, থানা-নাগরপুর, জেলা- টাঙ্গাইলকে আসামীভুক্ত করেন তবে তিনি কোন আসামীর ঠিকানা যাচাই করেননি। তিনি বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক ও সোনালী ব্যাংক গঠিত দুটি তদন্ত কমিটির তদন্ত প্রতিবেদনের ওপর ভিত্তি করে অনুসন্ধান প্রতিবেদন দাখিল করেন। ফলে ভুয়া নাম ঠিকানা সম্বলিত ব্যক্তিকেও আসামীভুক্ত করা হয়। এখানে লক্ষণীয়, ইওকে ২৬-১২-২০১০ খ্রিঃ তারিখে অনুসন্ধানকারী কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ করে যে নির্দেশনা প্রদান করা হয়েছিল সেখানে দুদক বিধিমালা, ২০০৭ অনুসরণ করে অনুসন্ধান প্রতিবেদন দাখিল করার কথা বলা হয়েছিল। কিন্তু তিনি মোটেই দুদক বিধিমালা অনুসরণ করে তার অনুসন্ধান রিপোর্ট দাখিল করেননি। তিনি প্রায় ১৪ মাস যাবৎ তার অনুসন্ধান করেছেন কিন্তু এই ১৪ মাসে অনুসন্ধান করে কি পেলেন? তিনি তো সরেজমিনে কোন অনুসন্ধানই করেননি। তিনি শুধুমাত্র বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক ও সোনালী ব্যাংকের প্রাপ্ত প্রতিবেদনের ওপর ভিত্তি করে তার রিপোর্ট দাখিল করেছেন। এটা কোন ভাবেই ঠিক হয়নি। সরেজমিনে অনুসন্ধানেই বের হয়ে আসত। অনুসন্ধানকালে তদারককারী মুহাম্মদ আশরাফ আলী ফারুক এর কোন Contribution দেখা যায় না। এছাড়া সংশ্লিষ্ট ডেস্ক অফিসার কিংবা মহাপরিচালকও তাদের নোটে এ বিষয়ে কোন কিছু বলেননি। তারা যত্নশীল হলে অনুসন্ধান পর্যায়েই এই মামলাগুলির ত্রুটি বিচ্যুতি উদ্ঘাটন করা সম্ভব হত।   <br />   <br />তদন্তকালে সংঘটিত ত্রুটি বিচ্যুতি:   <br />১. তদন্তকালে বিভিন্ন ব্যাংক হিসাবে ব্যবহৃত মোঃ আবু সালেকসহ অন্যান্য নামের (যাদের প্রকৃত নাম ও ঠিকানা পাওয়া যায়নি) ছবি দিয়ে তাদেরকে ধরিয়ে দেয়ার জন্য বা তাদের প্রকৃত পরিচয় জানানোর জন্য বিভিন্ন জাতীয় দৈনিক পত্রিকা ও বিভিন্ন টিভি চ্যানেলে বিজ্ঞাপন প্রদানের ব্যবস্থা না করা।   <br />২. মোঃ জাহালমকে বিভিন্ন মামলায় তার সহযোগী হিসেবে উল্লিখিত আসামীদের সাথে মুখোমুখী জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ না করা।   <br />৩. মোঃ জাহালমের ইংরেজী লিখতে না জানা তথা লিখা পড়া না জানা, তার সামাজিক অবস্থান ও আর্থিক সঙ্গতি বিবেচনায় না নেয়া। এগুলি ঠিকমত বিবেচনা করলে তখনই উদ্ঘাটিত হত যে, জাহালম প্রকৃত আসামী নয়।   <br />৪. বিভিন্ন ভুয়া নাম ঠিকানা ব্যবহার করে খোলা ব্যাংক নিরূপন না করা এবং সেই উদ্দেশ্য অনুযায়ী তাদেরকে আসামী/সাক্ষী না করা। একজন ব্যক্তি অপর কোন ব্যক্তির একাউন্টে পরিচয়দানকারী হলেই বলা যায় না যে সেই ব্যক্তির অপকর্মের সাথে জড়িত। এখানে দেখা উচিত ছিল সে কেন পরিচয়দানকারী হয়েছিল?   <br />৫. ব্যাংক নিয়ম ভঙ্গ করে গ্রাহককে অতিরিক্ত চেক বই সরবরাহ ও লেনদেন পরিচালনায় সহায়তাকারী কর্মকর্তাগণের দায়-দায়িত্ব সঠিকভাবে নিরূপন না করা।   <br />৬. এই তদন্তে আত্মসাৎ হয়েছে ১৮ কোটির টাকারও বেশি কিন্তু তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাগণ এই টাকা কোথায় গেল সে বিষয়ে পর্যাপ্ত তথ্য সংগ্রহ করেননি। মানিলন্ডারিং সংক্রান্ত মামলার তদন্তের ক্ষেত্রে “follow the money” একটি কার্যকরী তদন্ত tool। অর্থের গন্তব্যের বিষয়ে তদন্ত করলেই এবং গন্তব্য খুজে পাওয়া গেলে স্বাভাবিক ভাবেই অপরাধীর খোঁজ পাওয়া যায়। এক্ষেত্রে সেটা করা হয়নি। এটি তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাদের একটি ব্যর্থতা/অযোগ্যতা ছিল।   <br />৭. এই মামলায় অনেক ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তা জড়িত থাকলেও এবং তারা ক্ষমতায় অপব্যবহার করে থাকলেও তাদের কাউকে ১৯৪৭ সনের দুর্নীতি প্রতিরোধ আইনের ৫(২) ধারায় অভিযুক্ত করা হয়নি। কিন্তু তাদেরকে উক্ত ধারায় চার্জশীটভুক্ত করা উচিত ছিল।   <br />৮. এই ৩৩ টি মামলার পূর্বের যে একটি মামলা (মতিঝিল থানা মামলা নং ২৩ তারিখ: ১৪-৯-২০১০) যা ব্যাংক ইসলাম সাগর ও সাইফুল হক এর ১৬৪ ধারায় জবানবন্দী গ্রহণ করা হয়েছিল। উক্ত মামলায় ফাইনাল রিপোর্ট দাখিল করা হয় কিন্তু পরবর্তীতে বর্তমান কোন মামলাতেই উক্ত ব্যক্তিদের ১৬৪ ধারায় জবানবন্দী গ্রহণের কোন উদ্যোগ গ্রহণ করা হয়নি। এতে স্বভাবতঃই মামলাগুলি দুর্বল হয়ে গেছে।   <br />৯. এই মামলার আসামী আমিনুল হক ওরফে হক সাহেবের ব্র্যাক ব্যাংকের ২টি একাউন্টে (রোকেয়া সরণী ব্রাঞ্চ ও মিরপুর ব্রাঞ্চ) রক্ষিত ৮২,০১,০০০ টাকা এবং মানিকগঞ্জ সদর থানার ৪৩৩ শতক জমি বিশেষ জজ আদালত নং-৪ এর বিশেষ ২০/১৫ নং মামলায় ২৯-১০-২০১৮ খ্রিঃ তারিখের আদেশের ফ্রিজ/ক্রোক করা হয়। এই ব্যক্তির একুশ শতকের উন্নয়ন নামে মানিকগঞ্জের একটি এনজিও ছিল। সুতরাং প্রাথমিকভাবে প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, এই ব্যক্তি আত্মসাতকৃত টাকার একটি বড় অংশের ভাগ পেয়েছিলেন। এ ধরণের একজন আসামীকে কেন রিমান্ডে এসে ব্যাপকভাবে জিজ্ঞাসাবাদের উদ্যোগ গ্রহণ করা হয়নি তা বোধগম্য নয়। তাকে জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করলেই তার কাছ থেকে এই মামলাসমূহের সকল তথ্য পাওয়ার সম্ভাবনা ছিল।   <br />১০. এই ৩৩টি মামলাগুলিতে প্রায় ১২ জন আইও তদন্ত রিপোর্ট কমিশনে দাখিল করেছিলেন কিন্তু তাদের কেউই আসামী জাহালমের বাড়ি পরিদর্শন করেননি। আমি আমার তদন্তকালে জাহালমের বাড়ি পরিদর্শন করেছি। তার বাড়িটির দৈন্য দশা এতটাই প্রকট যে, যে কোন ব্যক্তিরই সন্দেহ হওয়া স্বাভাবিক যে, ১৮ কোটি টাকা আত্মসাতের সাথে জড়িত একজন ব্যক্তির বাড়ির এই দৈন্য দশা কেনঃ তার বাড়ি পরিদর্শন করলেই আইওদের মনে সন্দেহ দেখা দিত। জাহালমকে যখন দুদকের আইওগণ প্রথমে দেখে তখন সে একজন পাটকল শ্রমিক। এই প্রশ্নটি কেন আইওদের মনে আসল না সেটি বোধগম্য নয়।   <br />১১. এই ৩৩ টি মামলার পূর্বে যে মামলাটি দায়ের করা হয়েছিল (মতিঝিল থানা মামলা নং ২৩ তারিখ: ১৪-৯-২০১০) সে মামলাটি প্রথমে পুলিশ তদন্ত শুরু করে পরবর্তীতে মামলাটি তদন্তের জন্য দুর্নীতি দমন কমিশনে প্রেরণ করা হয়। একই ঘটনা অনুসন্ধান করে দুদক কর্তৃক পরবর্তীতে ৩৩ টি মামলা দায়ের করা হয় এবং পূর্বের মামলাটিতে (মতিঝিল থানা মামলা নং ২৩ তারিখ: ১৪-৯-২০১০) এফআরটি দাখিল করা হয় এবং পরবর্তীতে পৃথক পৃথকভাবে ৩৩ টি মামলা দায়ের করার কোন প্রয়োজন ছিল না। পূর্বের মামলাটিতেই তদন্ত করে দুদক কর্তৃক চার্জশীট দেয়া সম্ভব ছিল। সেটা করলেই বরং ভাল হত। ৩৩ টি পৃথক মামলা করে পৃথক পৃথক সিডি খুলে তদন্ত করতে গিয়ে বিভিন্ন জটিলতার সৃষ্টি হয়েছে এবং বিভিন্ন আইওদের মধ্যে সমন্বয়হীনতা হয়েছে। এখানে পূর্বের মামলাটি রেখে সেখানে কয়েকজন আইওকে দিয়ে একটি তদন্ত কমিটি করে দিলে সেটিই অধিক ফলপ্রসূ হত। রেকর্ডপত্র অনুযায়ী ৩৩ টি মামলা রুজুর পর মামলাসমূহ তদন্তের জন্য সহকারী পরিচালক মোছাঃ সেলিনা আক্তার মনি (বর্তমানে উপ-পরিচালক) কে ২টি, সহকারী পরিচালক সুমিত্রা সেনকে ২টি, সহকারী পরিচালক ফয়সাল মাহমুদকে ৩টি, উপসহকারী পরিচালক মোঃ জাকারিয়া হোসেনকে ৫টি, উপসহকারী পরিচালক সিলভিয়া ফেরদৌসকে ২টি, সহকারী পরিচালক এ এস এম সাজ্জাদ হোসেন (বর্তমানে উপ-পরিচালক) কে ২টি, সহকারী পরিচালক মোঃ আল আমিনকে ২টি, উপ-সহকারী পরিচালক মুহাম্মদ জয়নাল আবেদিন (বর্তমানে সহকারী পরিচালক) কে ২টি, সহকারী পরিচালক মোঃ নাজমুস সাদাতকে ৩টি, উপসহকারী পরিচালক শংকর কুমার চক্রবর্তীকে ৪টি, উপসহকারী পরিচালক রাফী মোঃ নাজমুস সাদাতকে ২টি মামলার তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ করা হয়। তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাগণ সকলেই ২০১১ সনের আগষ্ট মাসে নিয়োগপ্রাপ্ত শিক্ষানবিশ কর্মকর্তা ছিলেন। কমিশন কর্তৃক আয়োজিত মৌলিক প্রশিক্ষণ শেষে তদন্তকাজে সম্পৃক্ত করা হয়। আইওগণ চাকুরীতে যোগদান করেন ৭-৮-২০১১ খ্রিঃ তারিখে। ইন হাউজ প্রশিক্ষণ শেষে তারা বিপিএটিসিতে প্রশিক্ষণে যোগদান করেন। বিপিএটিসি হতে ১১-৪-২০১১ খ্রিঃ তারিখে অবমুক্ত হওয়ার পর পরই তারা এই মামলার তদন্তভার পান এবং এটা ছিল তাদের জীবনের প্রথম তদন্ত। প্রথমদিকে উল্লিখিত সবগুলি মামলার তদারককারী কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ করা হয় জনাব আব্দুল্লাহ- আল-জাহিদ, উপ-পরিচালককে। তিনি তদারককারী কর্মকর্তা নিযুক্ত হওয়ার কিছুদিন পর সমন্বিত জেলা কার্যালয়, ঢাকা-২ এর উপ-পরিচালক হিসেবে যোগদান করেন। ফলে তার পক্ষে মামলার তদন্ত কার্যক্রম নিবিড়ভাবে তদারক করা সম্ভব ছিল না। তদুপরি কমিশনের অনুসন্ধান/তদন্ত কার্যক্রমের সঠিক ও নিবিড় তদারকি ব্যবস্থা গড়ে না ওঠায় তদারক কাজ দায়সারাভাবেই চলে আসছে। ফলে নবীন কর্মকর্তাদের অভিজ্ঞতা ও দক্ষতার অভাব ও কাজের যথাযথ তদারকি ব্যবস্থার অনুপস্থিতিতে এ ধরনের ত্রুটি বিচ্যুতি সংঘটিত হয়েছে মর্মে প্রতীয়মান হয়। পরবর্তীতে অনুষ্ঠিত অধিকতর তদন্তেও বিভিন্ন ভুয়া নাম ঠিকানা ব্যবহার করে খোলা ব্যাংক হিসাবে পরিচয়দানকারী এবং ব্যাংক নিয়ম ভঙ্গ করে গ্রাহককে অতিরিক্ত চেক বই সরবরাহ ও লেনদেন পরিচালনায় সহায়তাকারী ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাগণের দায়-দায়িত্ব সঠিকভাবে নিরূপন করা হয়নি। ফলে মামলাগুলোর অধিকতর তদন্ত হওয়া সমীচীন হবে। উক্ত অর্থ আত্মসাতের ঘটনায় রুজুকৃত ৩৩ টি মামলার একটি সার-সংক্ষেপ অত্র প্রতিবেদনের সাথে যুক্ত করা হলো (সংযুক্ত পতাকা খ-১৪ পাতা)।   <br />   <br />সার্বিক বিবেচনায় আমার নিকট প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, জাহালমকে আবু সালেক রূপে চিহ্নিত করার যে ভুলটি হয়েছে তা দুদকের তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাদের কারণেই ঘটেছে। আর তাদেরকে ভুল পথে চালিত করতে সহায়তা করেছে ব্র্যাক ব্যাংক ও অন্যান্য ব্যাংকের কর্মকর্তাবৃন্দ এবং একাউন্টের ভুয়া ব্যক্তিকে পরিচয়দানকারীরা। তবে সঠিক ঘটনা তথা সত্য উদ্ঘাটন করে আদালতের নিকট তা উপস্থাপন করাটাই তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তার দায়িত্ব। এক্ষেত্রে ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাদের ওপর বা অন্য কারোর ওপর এই দায়িত্ব অর্পণ করার কোন সুযোগ নেই। বিশেষ করে তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাদের এটা লক্ষ্য করা উচিত ছিল যে প্রথমে কিন্তু ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তারা কিংবা একাউন্টের সনাক্তকারীরা আবুসালেককে সনাক্ত করতে কিংবা তাকে খুজে বের করতে তৎপর হয়নি। যখন ৩টি মামলায় (ধানমন্ডি থানা মামলা নং ৯, তারিখ: ১০-৪-২০১২, শাহ আলী থানা মামলা নং ১৪, তারিখ ১০-৪-২০২১ এবং আদাবর থানা মামলা নং ১৫, তারিখ: ১০-৪-২০১২) চার্জশীট দাখিল করা হয় এবং সেখানে ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাদের আসামী করা হয় তখন তারা বুঝতে পারে যে, মূল আসামী আবুসালেককে খুজে বের করে দিতে না পারলে তারা নিশ্চিতভাবেই বাকী মামলাগুলিতে আসামী হয়ে যাবে। তখন তারা যেভাবেই হোক আবুসালেককে খুজে বের করতে মরিয়া হয়ে উঠে। যে কাজটি তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাদের করা উচিত ছিল সে কাজটি করতে মাঠে নেমে পড়ে ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তারা। তারা যেনতেন প্রকারে একজন আবুসালেককে দুদকের সামনে হাজির করে ও তাকে আবুসালেক রূপে সনাক্ত করে। ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তারা যে নিজেদের বাচাতে যে কোন ব্যক্তিকে আবুসালেক হিসেবে সনাক্ত করতে পারে এই সম্ভাবনাটাই তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তারা ভেবে দেখেননি। তদারককারীও আইওদেরকে এই বিষয়ে সঠিক দিকনির্দেশনা দিতে ব্যর্থ হয়েছেন। এই ৩৩টি মামলার আইওগণ সিরিয়াস/সঠিকভাবে মামলার তদন্ত করেননি। প্রত্যেকেই একে অন্যের উপর নির্ভরশীল ছিল। প্রত্যেকেরই আশা ছিল অন্যরা তদন্তে কোন অগ্রগতি করলে তারা সেটি কপি করবে এবং সেটিই তারা করেছে। এরমধ্যে শুধু ব্যতিক্রম ছিল সেলিনা আক্তার মনি। শুধুমাত্র সে-ই আবুসালেককে সনাক্ত করা বা খুজে বের করার জন্য তৎপর ছিল।   <br />   <br />কিন্তু সেও কাজটি নিজে না করে ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাদের দিয়ে সেটি করাতে চেয়েছিল। সে যদি নিজেই আবুসালেককে খোজার জন্য টাঙ্গাইল/শ্যামলীতে যেত (যেটা ফয়সাল কায়েস করেছে) তবে হয়ত এই ভুলটি হত না। আরও দেখা যাচ্ছে সেলিনা আক্তার মনির চাপে পড়ে ফয়সাল কায়েস যে ব্যক্তিকে আবুসালেক হিসেবে হাজির করল তাকেই সকল আইও আবুসালেক হিসেবে মেনে নিল। এখানে তদারককারীর কোন কার্যকর ভূমিকাই দেখা যাচ্ছে না। এই নবীন ও অনভিজ্ঞ কর্মকর্তারা এ ধরণের ভুল করে যাচ্ছে, একজনের তদন্ত অন্য জন কপি করছে এ বিষয়গুলি তদারককারীর তদারক করা উচিত ছিল। উল্লেখ্য, এই তদারককারী হচ্ছেন সেই তদারককারী যিনি অভিযোগের অনুসন্ধান করে ৩৩ টি মামলা রুজুর সুপারিশ করেছিলেন এবং তিনিই ছিলেন এজাহারকারী। তিনি ছিলেন ব্যুরোর আমলের একজন সিনিয়র কর্মকর্তা। তার উচিত ছিল এই নবীন ও অনভিজ্ঞ কর্মকর্তাদের গাইড করা। অনুসন্ধানকালে যে ত্রুটি বিচ্যুতি ছিল তিনি সেগুলি সঠিক করে নিতে পারতেন। কিন্তু তিনি সেটা করতে ব্যর্থ হয়েছেন। মামলার আইওগণ ও তদারককারী আরও যত্নবান হলে বা উপরে উল্লিখিত বিষয়গুলি অনুসরণ করলে এই মারাত্মক ভুলটি হত না। তবে তাদের এ ভুলটি সরল বিশ্বাসে হয়েছে নাকি উদ্দেশ্য প্রণোদিতভাবে হয়েছে তা সাক্ষ্য দ্বারা প্রমাণের বিষয়। এটি শুধুমাত্র মাননীয় আদালত নির্ধারণ করতে পারেন।

মামলাগুলির মধ্যে বাড্ডা থানার মামলা নং ২৩, তারিখ ১০-৪-২০১২ মামলাটির তথ্য বিশ্লেষণ করে দেখা যায় যে, অধিকতর তদন্তের জন্য মামলাটি কমিশনের অনুদন লাভ করে ১১-৩-২০১৮ খ্রিঃ তারিখে। এরপর ১৪-৩-২০১৮ খ্রিঃ তারিখে তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তার প্রতি অধিকতর তদন্ত প্রতিবেদন দাখিল করার জন্য পত্র প্রেরণ করা হয়। তিনি তদন্ত প্রতিবেদন দাখিল না করায় ২৮-৮-২০১৮ খ্রিঃ তারিখে তার প্রতি তাগিদপত্র ইস্যু করা হয়। গত ১৭-১০-২০১৮ খ্রিঃ তারিখে অধিকতর তদন্ত রিপোর্ট কমিশনে দাখিল করা হয়। অধিকতর তদন্ত রিপোর্ট প্রাপ্তির পর ১০-১২-২০১৮ খ্রিঃ তারিখ জাহালম এর বিরুদ্ধে প্রসিকিউশন প্রত্যাহারের এবং প্রকৃত আসামী মোঃ আবু করার সিদ্ধান্ত গৃহীত হয়। জাহালমের প্রসিকিউশন প্রত্যাহার সংক্রান্ত পত্র আইনজীবীর নিকট প্রেরণ করা হয় ২৭-১২-২০১৮ খ্রিঃ তারিখে। আইনজীবী বিশেষ আদালতে প্রসিকিউশন প্রত্যাহারের দরখাস্ত দাখিল করেন ৫-২-২০১৯ খ্রিঃ তারিখে। বিশেষ জজ আদালত দরখাস্ত প্রাপ্তির পর নথিটি সিনিয়র স্পেশাল জজ আদালতে প্রেরণ করেন ৫-২-২০১৯ খ্রিঃ তারিখে। কিন্তু ইতোপূর্বেই মামলায় হাইকোর্ট বিভাগের নির্দেশে ৩-২-২০১৯ খ্রিঃ তারিখে জাহালমকে হাজত থেকে মুক্তি দেয়া হয়। এখানে দেখা যাচ্ছে যে, মামলার অধিকতর তদন্তের আইও তদন্ত করতে প্রায় ৭ মাস সময় নিয়েছেন। একটি অধিকতর তদন্তের ক্ষেত্রে এ দীর্ঘ সময় নেয়াটা যথার্থ হয়নি।   <br />   <br />যেহেতু এ মামলাটিতে অধিকতর তদন্তের শুরু থেকেই বোঝা যাচ্ছিল জাহালম প্রকৃত আবুসালেক নয় সেহেতু অন্য মামলার তদন্তে সময় কম দিয়ে এই মামলার তদন্তটি দ্রুত সমাপ্ত করা উচিত ছিল। এ বিষয়ে কার্যকর তদারেকর অভাব ছিল। এছাড়া রিপোর্ট দাখিলের পর হতে আইনজীবীদের নিকট লেগেছে প্রায় ২ মাস। সংশ্লিষ্ট ডেস্ক অফিসারগণ আরও তৎপর/আন্তরিক হলে এ সময়টিও আরও কমানো যেত। এখানে উল্লেখ্য যে, মামলায় হাইকোর্ট বিভাগের আদেশবলে জাহালম ৩-২-২০১৯ খ্রিঃ তারিখে যখন আদালত থেকে মুক্তি প্রদান করে তখন তার বিরূদ্ধে ৫ টি মামলায় PW ইস্যু করা ছিল।   <br />   <br /><strong>(ঙ) ভবিষ্যতে এ ধরনের ঘটনা রোধে অনুসন্ধান ও তদন্তের যে সকল পদ্ধতিগত সংস্কার প্রয়োজন:</strong>   <br />১. অনুসন্ধান ও তদন্ত কাজে কার্যকর তদারকী ব্যবস্থা প্রতিষ্ঠা:   <br />এ লক্ষ্যে দক্ষ ও অভিজ্ঞ পরিচালক ও উপ-পরিচালক পর্যায়ের কর্মকর্তাগণের সমন্বয়ে একটি অনুসন্ধান/তদন্ত তদারকী প্যানেল গঠন করা যেতে পারে এবং অনুসন্ধান/তদন্ত কাজের তদারকী কর্মকর্তা উক্ত প্যানেল হতে নিয়োগ করা যেতে পারে। তদারককারী কর্মকর্তাগণ যাতে সঠিক ও যথাযথভাবে তদারক কাজ সম্পন্ন করতে পারেন সে জন্য তদারককারী কর্মকর্তাগণকে বিশেষ ক্ষেত্র ব্যতীত ব্যক্তিগতভাবে অনুসন্ধান/তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ না করাই সমীচীন হবে। কমিশনের সমন্বিত জেলা কার্যালয়ের উপ-পরিচালকগণ পদাধিকার বলে তাদের অধীনস্থ কর্মকর্তাগণের অনুসন্ধান/তদন্ত কাজ তদারকী করেন বিধায় তাদের ক্ষেত্রেও এ নীতি প্রয়োগ করা যেতে পারে।   <br />   <br />২. Trail the Money নীতি প্রতিষ্ঠা করা:   <br />কোন দুর্নীতির অপরাধ সংঘটনের পর উক্ত ঘটনার প্রকৃত সুবিধাভোগী কে/কারা তা নির্ধারণ এবং সুবিধাভোগীদের আইনের আওতায় আনার জন্য Trail the Money অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। “Trail the Money” অনুসরণ করলে আলোচ্য ক্ষেত্রে জাহালমের মত নির্দোষ ব্যক্তি হয়রানীর হাত হতে থেকে রেহাই পেতেন।   <br />   <br />৩. Forensic Accounts Department প্রতিষ্ঠা:   <br />অপরাধ লব্ধ অর্থ/সম্পদের গতিবিধি অনুসরণ করে মূল অপরাধী সনাক্ত করা ও অপরাধ লব্ধ সম্পদ উদ্ধারের লক্ষ্যে এবং Trail the Money কার্যকর করার জন্য কমিশনে একটি Forensic Accounts Department প্রতিষ্ঠা করা প্রয়োজন। একটি দুর্নীতির অভিযোগের অনুসন্ধান বা মামলা তদন্তকালে অর্থের Flow chart তৈরী এবং Financial Transection Profile তৈরী ও প্রমাণের জন্য Forensic Accountant খুবই গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ভুমিকা পালন করতে পারে। অনুসন্ধানকারী/তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাগণকে সহযোগিতার জন্য টিম গঠন পূর্বক অনুসন্ধান/তদন্ত কার্যক্রম পরিচালনা করা যেতে পারে এবং একজন Forensic Accountant কে টিমের সদস্য করা যেতে পারে।   <br />   <br />৪. সাক্ষী ও আসামীগণের ব্যক্তিগত তথ্য যাচাইয়ের ব্যবস্থা প্রবর্তন:   <br />একজন আসামী বা সাক্ষী পরিচয় নিশ্চিত করার ব্যবস্থা গ্রহণ করতে হবে। এ কাজে নির্বাচন কমিশনের জাতীয় পরিচয়পত্র প্রকল্পের তথ্য ভাণ্ডার ব্যবহার করা যেতে পারে। উক্ত তথ্য ভাণ্ডার ব্যবহারের জন্য নির্বাচন কমিশনের সাথে একটি MOU স্বাক্ষর করা যেতে পারে।   <br />   <br />৫. অনুসন্ধান নোট বই ও কেস ডাইরী যথাযথভাবে লিখন ও সংরক্ষণের ব্যবস্থা গ্রহণ:   <br />অনুসন্ধান/তদন্ত কাজের মান নিশ্চিত করার লক্ষ্যে যথাযথভাবে অনুসন্ধান নোট বই/কেস ডাইরী লিখন ও সংরক্ষণ নিশ্চিত করতে হবে। অনুসন্ধান নোট বই ও কেস থাকতে হবে। তদারককারী কর্মকর্তার পূর্ণাঙ্গ মতামত ব্যতীত কোন অনুসন্ধান প্রতিবেদন বা সাক্ষ্য-স্মারক শাখা কর্তৃক কমিশনের নিকট উপস্থাপন না করার বিষয়টি নিশ্চিত করতে হবে। ভবিষ্যতে কোন নিরপরাধ ব্যক্তি ভুলভাবে আসামীভুক্ত হলে তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তার সাথে সাথে তদারককারী কর্মকর্তাদেরও জবাবদিহিতার আওতায় আনতে হবে।   <br />   <br />৬. গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আসামীদের রিমান্ডে এনে ব্যাপক ও নিবিড় জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করে ১৬৪ ধারায় জবানবন্দী রেকর্ডের ব্যবস্থা গ্রহণ:   <br />কোন মামলা তদন্তকালে যদি এমন কোন গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আসামী পাওয়া যায় যে, সে অপরাধের সাথে জড়িত মর্মে বিশ্বাস করার জোরালো প্রমাণ থাকে, তাহলে তার জবানবন্দী ফৌজদারি কার্যবিধির ১৬৪ ধারায় রেকর্ড করার ব্যবস্থা করতে হবে। যেমন: আলোচ্য মামলাটিতে আমিনুল হক একজন গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আসামী যার নিকট আত্মসাৎকৃত টাকার একটি উল্লেখযোগ্য অংশ আছে মর্মে প্রতীয়মান হচ্ছে। এ ধরনের আসামীকে রিমান্ডে এনে ব্যাপক ও নিবিড় জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করে ফৌজদারি কার্যবিধির ১৬৪ ধারায় আসামীর জবানবন্দী রেকর্ডের ব্যবস্থা করলে তার কাছ থেকে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ তথ্য পাওয়া যেতে পারে।   <br />   <br />৭. একই ঘটনা থেকে একাধিক মামলা দায়ের না করা:   <br />এই মামলাগুলিতে দেখা যাচ্ছে যে, একই ঘটনা থেকে মোট ৩৩ টি মামলা দায়ের হয়েছে। এতে অহেতুক জটিলতার সৃষ্টি হয়েছে। এখানে পূর্বে দায়েরকৃত একটি মামলাতেই একজন অভিজ্ঞ ও দক্ষ আইও নিযুক্ত করে দিলে তদন্ত কার্যক্রম অধিক ফলপ্রসূ হত। এখানে মূল ঘটনাস্থল একটিই অর্থাৎ সোনালী ব্যাংক লিঃ, মিরপুর ক্যান্টনমেন্ট শাখা। এখান থেকেই মূলতঃ টাকাগুলি আত্মসাৎ হয়েছে। উত্তোলন হয়েছে অন্যান্য বিভিন্ন স্থান থেকে। এখানে মূল পিও হচ্ছে সোনালী ব্যাংক লিঃ, মিরপুর ক্যান্টনমেন্ট শাখা। এটাকে পিও বিবেচনা করলে মামলা একটিই হওয়া উচিত। সুতরাং একটি মামলা হলে আইনগত কোন অসুবিধা হত না বরং তাতে তদন্ত কাজের সুবিধা হত। ভবিষ্যতে এ বিষয়গুলিতে সংশ্লিষ্ট অফিসারগণকে আরও সতর্ক ও দায়িত্বশীল হতে হবে।   <br />   <br />৮. বেনামী চিঠির বিষয়ে তদন্ত:   <br />আমার তদন্তকালীন সময়ে মাননীয় চেয়ারম্যানের মাধ্যমে আমি একটি পত্র প্রাপ্ত হই (ফটোকপি সংযুক্ত পতাকা-গ-১ পাতা)। সেখানে উল্লেখ করা হয় যে, জাহালম টাকার বিনিময়ে আবুসালেক সেজে জেল খাটবে এবং এর বিনিময়ে সে অর্থ প্রাপ্ত হবে। এর সাথে দুদকের ২ জন কর্মকর্তা এবং ব্র্যাক ব্যাংকের একজন কর্মকর্তা জড়িত মর্মে উল্লেখ করা হয়। আমাদের দেশে একজন আসামীর কিন্তু বিষয়টি তদন্ত করে উদ্ঘাটন করতে হলে যে ব্যাপক তদন্তের প্রয়োজন তা এই তদন্ত কমিটির পক্ষে সম্ভব নয়। কর্মকর্তাদেরকে নির্দেশনা দেয়া যেতে পারে।   <br />   <br />৯. মামলার তদন্ত গোপনে দ্রুত শেষ করা:   <br />যে কোন মামলার দ্রুত তদন্ত শেষ করা প্রয়োজন পারে এবং আসামীরা পালিয়ে যেতে পারে। এই মামলাটিতে তদন্ত সম্পন্ন করতে এবং অধিকতর তদন্ত সম্পন্ন করতে অস্বাভাবিক বিলম্ব হয়েছে। আমি আমার তদন্তকালে অনুভব করি যে, মামলাটিতে পুনরায় অধিকতর তদন্ত করা প্রয়োজন। সেজন্য আমি বিষয়টি উল্লেখ করে জরুরী ভিত্তিতে ২৪-২-২০১৯ খ্রিঃ তারিখে একটি অন্তবর্তীকালীন তদন্ত রিপোর্ট দাখিল করি। মাননীয় কমিশন তা অনুমোদন করে ৪ টি মামলা অধিকতর তদন্তের জন্য নির্দেশ প্রদান করেন। এর মধ্যে প্রথম আইও নিয়োগ করা হয় ১০-৩-২০১৯ খ্রিঃ তারিখে। আইওগণ মহাপরিচালক (লিগ্যাল) ও আমার সাথে বিভিন্ন সময়ে তদন্ত কার্যক্রম বিষয়ে মৌখিকভাবে পরামর্শ করেছে। এতদসত্ত্বেও তাদের মর্মে মনে হয়। এছাড়া বাকী মামলাগুলিও অধিকতর তদন্ত করা প্রয়োজন মর্মে প্রতীয়মান হয়।   <br />   <br />১০. বিজ্ঞ আইনজীবীগণ কর্তৃক আরও সঠিকভাবে মামলা পরিচালনা করা:   <br />তদন্তকালে মামলাগুলির অর্ডারশীট ও অন্যান্য কিছু কাগজপত্রের কপি আদালত থেকে সংগ্রহ করা হয়। সেখানে দেখা যায় যে, সকল মামলাতেই জাহালমকে আটক দেখানো হয়নি। কিছু কিছু মামলায় জাহালমকে পলাতক দেখানো আছে এবং মামলার শুরু থেকেই এটা হয়ে আসছে। যেখানে একই আদালতে একই আসামীর ভিন্ন ভিন্ন মামলার বিচার চলছে এবং কিছু ক্ষেত্রে দুদক পক্ষে নিযুক্ত আইনজীবী একই ব্যক্তি সেখানে একটি মামলায় আসামী উপস্থিত ও অন্য মামলায় আসামী পলাতক দেখানো মোটেই উচিত নয়। দুদকের বিজ্ঞ আইনজীবীর উচিত ছিল বিষয়টি আদালতের নজরে আনা। একজন ব্যক্তি একটি মামলায় হাজতে আর অন্য মামলায় যদি পলাতক থাকে এবং প্রসিকিউশন সেটা যদি জানা সত্তেও আদালতের গোচরে না আনে তবে সেই আসামীর সাজা হলেও সেটা নিয়ে পরবর্তীতে প্রশ্ন উঠা স্বাভাবিক। জাহালমের যে বিচার চলছিল সেটা তো এটা জেনে চলছিল না যে, জাহালম নির্দোষ। সেটা তো এমনভাবেই চলছিল যে, জাহালম আসলেই দোষী। সুতরাং মামলাটি পরিচালনায় দুদকের আইনজীবীদের শৈথিল্য ছিল মর্মে প্রতীয়মান হয়। পরবর্তীতে এ ধরণের ক্ষেত্রে আইনজীবীদের আরো যত্নশীল হওয়া নির্দেশনা প্রদান করা প্রয়োজন।   <br />   <br />১১. গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আদেশ হওয়ার সাথে সাথে তা কমিশনকে জানানো:   <br />এই মামলাগুলিতে চার্জগঠনের সময় কয়েকজনকে ডিসচার্জ করা হয় কিন্তু বিষয়টি বিজ্ঞ আইনজীবীগণ কমিশনকে জানাননি। কমিশন যাদের বিরুদ্ধে চার্জশীট দাখিল করল তাদেরকে যদি বিজ্ঞ আদালত চার্জগঠনের সময় ডিসচার্জ করেন তবে তা সঙ্গে সঙ্গে কমিশনকে জানানো উচিত যাতে কমিশন উক্ত আদেশের বিরুদ্ধে উচ্চ আদালতে যাওয়ার বিষয় নূন্যতম সময়ে সিদ্ধান্ত নিতে পারে।   <br />   <br />১২. বিভাগীয় মামলায় ব্যবস্থা গ্রহণের বিষয় কমিশনকে অবহিত করণ প্রসঙ্গে:   <br />উপরোক্ত মামলাগুলিতে সোনালী ব্যাংক লিঃ, মিরপুর ক্যান্টনমেন্ট শাখার তৎকালীন ম্যানেজার আজিজুর রহমানের বিরুদ্ধে চার্জশীট দাখিল করে সাক্ষ্য-স্মারক করা হয় কিন্তু তাকে চার্জশীট থেকে বাদ দেয় হয় ও তার বিরুদ্ধে বিভাগীয় ব্যবস্থা গ্রহণের সুপারিশ করা হয়। কিন্তু তার বিরুদ্ধে আসলেই কোন বিভাগীয় ব্যবস্থা গ্রহণ করা হয়েছিল কিনা এ সংক্রান্ত কোন তথ্য কমিশনকে জানানো হয়নি। এ সকল ক্ষেত্রে কমিশনের কার্যকর Follow up থাকা উচিত।   <br />   <br />১৩. লিগ্যাল অনুবিভাগের মতামত গ্রহণ;   <br />এ মামলাগুলিতে কয়েকটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আইনগত প্রশ্ন জড়িত ছিল। যেমন একটি এজাহার থাকাবস্থায় একই ঘটনা নিয়ে পৃথক ৩৩ টি মামলা দায়ের করা হবে কিনা। পূর্বের একটি মামলায় আসামীর ১৬৪ ধারায় প্রদত্ত জবানবন্দী অন্য মামলায় ব্যবহার করা যাবে কিনা। এই প্রশ্নগুলির কোন গ্রহণযোগ্য সমাধান ছাড়াই মামলা দায়ের করা হয়েছে এবং পরবর্তীতে চার্জশীট দাখিল করা হয়েছে। গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আইনগত প্রশ্ন জড়িত থাকলে অনুসন্ধান বা তদন্ত যে কোন পর্যায়েই হউক না কেন আবশ্যিকভাবে দুদকের লিগ্যাল অনুবিভাগের মতামত/পরামর্শ গ্রহণ করা প্রয়োজন।   <br />   <br />সংযুক্তি: বর্ণনানুযায়ী   <br />(আবুল হাসনাত মোঃ আবদুল ওয়াদুদ)   <br />পরিচালক (লিগ্যাল)   <br />দুর্নীতি দমন

<p>15. Another supplementary-affidavit was field on 15-7-2020, thereafter, again an affidavit-in-compliance was filed on 18-8-2019 about departmental proceeding and another supplementary affidavit dated 21-8- 2019 and another supplementary filed on behalf of the respondent No.1 dated 15- 1 2-20 1 9 and lastly on 8-1-2020.</p>
  
  <p>16. Mr Shaikh Mohammad Zakir Hossain, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No.8 Sonali Bank Limited filed an affidavit-in-opposition dated 21-8-2019 and thereafter a supplementary affidavit-in-opposition field on 7-11-20219 wherein stated that one Md Abu Salek son of Abdus Salam and Saleha Khatun opened a current account at Mirpur Cantonment Branch of Sonali Bank Ltd. on 8-2-2010&nbsp; bearing A/C No.001020974 using the address of Village-Gunipara, Salimaba Union, Nagarpur Police Station-Tangail. Thereafter on 19-5-2010, he opened another account in the same branch on his company name 'Mobile Mela' situated at Pallabi, Dhaka bearing A/C No.001021177. Mr Abu Salek is also a nominee of a bank account named 'Shamol Bangla Abashon' represented by Mr Nure Alam bearing A/C No.001021235 which was also opened in the same branch of Sonali Bank Ltd. Md Abu Salek in connivance with others misappropriated an amount of BDT 18,47,20,000(Eighteen Crore Forty Seven Lac Twenty Thousand) from Sonali Bank's reserve using the above mentioned accounts issuing 106 cheques in different period of times. He used to issue those cheques from these accounts and thereafter used to deposit those cheques in several scheduled banks of the country. Although there were insufficient balance in those accounts but through a fraudulent mechanism, the money used to get transferred to those scheduled banks from the Sonali Bank's reserve at Bangladesh Bank. Those cheques were issued in favour of different names including various business names. Mr Mainul Haque, an officer of Mirpur Cantonment Branch of Sonali Bank Limited was involved in the said money misappropriation. He used to illegally clear the cheques issued by Md Abu Salek, through fake clearance advices. He used to work in the bank as a delivery man with the responsibility to deliver all the cheques and vouchers from the Local Office to the Mirpur Cantonment Branch and vice versa.</p>

<p>17. It is also stated that cheque clearance process of Sonali Bank Ltd. at the relevant time was that all the cheques issued by the Sonali Bank Ltd. were first sent to their Local Office through the Bangladesh Bank Clearing House. The Sonali Bank Ltd. used a standard fanfold vouchers for clearance of those cheques. The said fanfold voucher contained three pages of three different colours (white, pink and green).
<br />
&nbsp; Whenever a cheque was deposited at a scheduled bank, the Sonali Bank Ltd. issued the said fanfold voucher for its clearance retaining the white voucher at its Local Office and sending the other two to the concerned Branch Office for verification. The authorized branch office, after verification, returned the pink voucher back to the Local office and retained green voucher for their records. The Local Office managed the transactions of those cheques through a statement issued by their Main Office and the next day, the local office would send the said statement to the clearance department of the head office. The clearance department thereafter would clear the said cheque after verifying the originating and responding entry. Mr Mainul Haque used to keep the cheques issued by Abu Salek separately and after creating fake clearing vouchers for those, he used to submit those vouchers in the Mirpur Cantonment Branch. The diagram of the cheque clearance process is given below.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">(a) A cheque when placed at a scheduled bank was first sent to the local office of Sonali Bank Ltd.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
&nbsp; (b) The LoCal officer would create a voucher for the cheque consisting of three pages of white, pink and green colours. The local office, while retaining the white coloured page, would send the pink and green coloured page to the branch office for verification.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
&nbsp; (c) The Branch Office, after verification, would retain the green coloured page and return the pink coloured page back to the local office for clearance</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
&nbsp; (d) The local office instructed the Bangladesh Bank to debit the money from their reserve to the concerned scheduled bank.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
&nbsp; (e) The Bangladesh Bank debited the money from the Sonali Bank's reserve to the concerned scheduled Bank.</p>

<p>18. The Sonali Bank Ltd. came to know about the said money misappropriation when two cheques amounting to BDT 55,70,000 issued from Mobile Mela's account, were cleared using fake clearance advices and deposited at the Brac Bank and Prime Bank.</p>

<p>19. It is further stated that the Sonali Bank Ltd. after being aware about the said money misappropriation, immediately lodged an FIR on 14-9-2010 under sections 420/406 of the Penal Code being Motijheel Police Station Case No.23 (9) 10 alleging, in alia, that Md Abu Salek Md Mainul Haque and others have misappropriated an amount of BDT 18,47,20,000 from the Sonali Bank's reserve, using 106 cheques issued in different period of times. The Vigilance and Control Department of Sonali Bank Limited startd their internal investigation immediately. They have carried out their investigation at Mirpur Cantonment

&nbsp; Branch, the local office and at the re-conciliation department of head office. They have also investigated the matter in those offices of the concerned scheduled banks where the said cheques were deposited. After completing the investigation they have submitted a report on 26-9-2010 with the findings that Md Abu Salek, Mainul Haque and others were involved in the said money misappropriation and that 106 cheques were placed at 33 branches of 17 scheduled banks where Md Abu Salek and other accused were the account holders. After complieting its investigation, the Sonali Bank Ltd. by a letter dated 26-9-2011 has charged Mr Mainul Haque for his affiliation in the said money misappropriation and later he was dismissed from his service on 12-10-2014. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) took up the investigation and lodged 33 FIR's in different police stations against those connected with the offence. The name of Md Jahalam was not included in any of those FIR's.</p>

<p>20. It is also stated that during the investigation of the aforesaid 33 cases, the ACC suddenly arrested Mr Md Jahalam who was a mere worker of Ghorashal Jute Mill while he was working. The ACC arrested him without any reasonable explanation or justification whatsoever. The ACC at the time arresting Mr Jahalam failed to consider that a man with worth of BDT 18 (Eighteen) crore cannot work in a jute mill as a worker. The ACC submitted charge-sheets for those cases where they included the name of Md Jahalam as accused along with others. In those charge-sheets, they have mentioned the name of Jahalam as one of the other names of Abu Salek in the form `Jahalam @ Abu Salek @ Golam Mortaza'. On 28-1-2019 a newspaper report was published in the Daily Prothom Alo captioned “৩৩ মামলাই ভুল আসামী জেল-সার, আমি জাহালম, সালেক না” where it was asserted that an innocent man namely Md Jahalam was unreasonable arrested by the ACC and kept in jail for 3 (three) years. The said news report also provided that Mr Jahalam has repeatedly pleaded to the ACC that he is an innocent poor man and he had no knowledge whatsoever about any money misappropriate, but the ACC charged him and kept him in jail for such a long time. On 2-2-2018 and 23-2-2018 a TV program based on the Jahalam's story was also aired on Channel 24 titled "Search Light" where they showed how the ACC immorally arrested the innocent Jahalam and kept him in Jail for 3 years for an offence he was not involved with. The ACC called one officer of Sonali Bank Limited at their office at Segunbagicha, Dhaka. In order to avoid their liability, the ACC forcefully made that bank officer sign a statement declaring that he had identified Md Jahalam as Abu Salek that officer after returning from officer of the ACC immediately wrote a letter to the Deputy Managing Director of the Sonali Bank Ltd., describing the matter that he was forced by the ACC officials to sign those statements.</p>

<p>21. It is further stated that the respondent No.8 after becoming aware of the wrongful arrest and unlawful detention of the innocent Jahalam carried out another investigation on this matter and submitted a report dated 18-2-2019, with the findings that when the ACC interrogated the officers of the Sonali Bank Ltd. just after the commission of the offence, those officers just provided them details about their roles in the bank and never indentified Mr Jahalam as Md Abu Salek. The Sonali Bank Ltd. neither has any power to make any investigation of a criminal case apart from their internal investigation procedure nor they have the power to arrest anyone and then take him into custody. It is further stated that the investigation authority appointed as per the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 and the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 contain the power to make an investigation and arrest any person related to it provided that they have reasonable grounds. The ACC arrested Md Jahalam and the Sonali Bank Limited had no involvement whatsoever in respect of arresting him and it had no actual knowledge about the wrongful detention.</p>

<p>22. It is further stated that the Sonali Bank Limited as the plaintiff filed a Money Suit being No.33 of 2012 before the learned Joint District Judge, 5th Court, Dhaka against a total of 74 respondents for the said misappropriation of money, however, nowhere in that suit there was anyone named Md Jahalam. The aforesaid money suit is still pending before the learned court and the respondent No.8 is the aggrieved party therein for their loss of such a significant amount of money. The ACC has mentioned in their enquiry report dated 30-5-2019 that their investigation officer got the responsibility to investigate on this matter just after he completed his training period. They also stated that this was his first investigation after the training period and that he had no previous experience of investigating such matter. The concept of vicarious liability/ employers' liability comes into play on this situation which states that when an employee has acted in a negligent manner, the employer will be held responsible for it. The employer is held liable for the action or omissions of his employees under this doctrine of law. As far as the instant case is concerned, the case of Nettleship vs Weston, 1971 EWCA Civ 6 can be invoked over here where the Court of Appeal made it clear that when a driver even if he is a learner driver drives his car on the road, he has to be treated as a competent driver. In this case salmon LJ held that;</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
&nbsp; "Any driver normally owes exactly the same duty to a passenger in his car as he does to the general public, namely to drive with reasonable care and skill in all the relevant circumstances. As a rule, the driver's personal idiosyncrasy [such as being a learner driver] is not a relevant circumstance"
</blockquote>

<p>23. Therefore, there is no scope for ACC to avoid their gross negligence by claiming that their Investigation officer was new and that he had just completed his training and that it was his first investigation as an investigation officer. The ACC cannot avoid their liability just by asserting that their investigation officer was not experienced and, as such, the ACC should be held liable for the wrongful detention of Mr Jahalam.</p>

<p>24. Mr Md Asaduzzaman, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the added respondent No.10 Brac Bank Limited filed an affidavit of facts dated 27-8-2019 and another affidavit of facts field on 23-10-2019 wherein stated that the enquiry report dated 30-5-2019 (Report) submitted by Mr Abul Hasnat Md Abdul Wadud, Directore (Legal), Anti-Corruption Commission, was placed before the Court on 16-7-2019 by the respondent No.1 through an affidavit-in-compliance dated 11-1-2019. Having received the said Report, the instant Added-respondent No.10 vide letter dated 29-7-2019 suspended Mr Md Faysal Kayes and Ms Sabina Sarmin, the two employees of the instant added respondent, whose names appeared in the report. The instant respondent has also issued show cause notices dated 29-7-2019 upon the said officers to explain about their conducts, which have been alleged in the said report dated 30-5-2019. Pursuant to receiving the said show cause notice, the two employees replied on 6-8-2019 respectively denying the materials allegations in the show cause notice, which are self-explanatory. Having gone through the replies of the employees, the instant respondent found it to be unsatisfactory for which vide notices dated 26-8- 2019, the instant respondent has framed charge against the employees and has taken steps to form an investigation committee. In the said notices dated 26-8-2019, the instant respondent has given the employees 7 days time to appoint their representatives in the investigation committee. That once the investigation committee is formed and it submits its report, the said 2 employees will be dealt with in accordance with law.</p>

<p>25. It is also stated that certain facts and developments took place with regard the disciplinary actions against the 2 employees of the instant respondent No.10 pursuant to filling the affidavit of facts dated 27- 8-2019 and the respondent No.10 wishes to bring those facts and developments by way of filing this supplementary affidavit of facts and prays for treating the same as part of the original affidavit of facts. Pursuant to framing charge on 26-8-2019, the instant respondent No.10 formed separate enquiry committees, comprising of members from both the bank and the employee to investigate the charges brought against the 2 employees of the bank and submits separate reports. Consequently, the said enquiry committees investigated the charges framed against the 2 employees and submitted their reports to the bank on 25-9-2019. It appears from the said reports that, the enquiry committee members found no direct involvement of Mr Md Faysal Kayes and Ms. Sabina Sarmin with Mr Abu Salek. However, the
<br />enquiry committee has found that Mr Md Faysal Kayes was reckless in performing his duties effectively. On the basis of the said reports, the instant Respondent No.10 withdrawn the suspension letter of Ms. Sabina San-nin vide letter dated 29-7-2019 and allowed her to resume office. With regard to Mr Faysal Kayes the instant respondent No.10 imposed a penalty of stoppage of salary increment for next 12 months for being reckless in performing job.</p>

<p>26. Mr Md Sumer Sattar, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the added respondent No.13 City Bank Limited filed an affidavit-in-opposition dated 7-11-2019 wherein stated that in due course of time, and during the pendency of the instant Suo-moto Rule, the respondent No.1 conducted a detailed investigation through its Director (legal), Mr Md Abdul Wadud (District and Sessions Judge,) Mr Wadud, after going through all evidence, prepared a report dated 30 May, 2019 (Annexurfe-X-19). In the report, the respondent No.1 pleaded that the investigators were misdirected to identify Mr Jahalam as Mr Md Abu Salek by the bank officers and bank account introducers. The Report, on page 12 stated that ;</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-family: &quot;Noto Sans Bengali&quot;, sans-serif; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
&nbsp; “সার্বিক বিবেচনায় আমার নিকট প্রতীয়মান হয়েছে যে, জাহালমকে আবুসালেক রূপে চিহ্নিত করার যে ভুলটি হয়েছে তা দুদকের তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাদের কারণেই ঘটেছে। আর তাদেরকে ভুল পথে চালিত করতে সহায়তা করেছে ব্র্যাক ব্যাংক ও অন্যান্য ব্যাংকের কর্মকর্তাবৃন্দ এবং অ্যাকাউন্টের ভুয়া ব্যক্তিকে পরিচয়দানকারীরা। তবে সঠিক ঘটনা তথা সত্য উদ্ঘাটন করে আদালতের নিকট তা উপস্থাপন করাটাই তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাদের দায়িত্ব। এক্ষেত্রে ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাদের ওপর বা অন্য কারও এই দায়িত্ব অর্পণ করার কোন সুযোগ নাই।”
</blockquote>

<p>27. Form the above, it is pertinent to mention that the Respondent No. I agrees that no responsibility shall lie on the officers of the banks in relation to investigation. Notwithstanding the findings of the respondent No.1, it is submitted that the respondent No.13 Bank is no way connected with the identification of Mr Jahalam as Mr Md Abu Salek. The report is clear and concise and there is no allegations against the respondent No.I3 Bank and/or its officers. It is stated that Mr Md Shakil, one of the persons who identified Mr Jahalam as Mr Md Abu Salek, is listed as a key witness in the Report. The only link between Mr Md Shakil and the respondent No.13 Bank is that Mr Md Shakil served as the introducer of Mr Golam Mortaza to the City Bank Ltd. Dhanmondi Branch. Mr Md Shakil is not an employee of the respondent No.13 Bank. In the report, the respondent No.1 inserted Mr Md Shakil as the fifth identifier of Mr Jahalam as Mr Md Abu Salek. The Report on page14 stated that:</p>

<p>28. At the time of hearing Mr Md Khurshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No. l , submits that the Anti-Corruption Commission took up the investigation at the instance of Bangladesh Bank and appointed investigation officer who after investigation submitted charge-sheet including the alleged Jahalam refen-ed to the enquiry report. The learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 submits that the investigation officers were misguided by the Bank Officials and the other persons including the local Chairman and Member of Duburia Union Parishad and submitted charge-sheet against Jahaalm and others. He placed the documents and evidence in relation of the investigation and submits that the officials of the respondent No.1 investigation officers have no malafide intension to implicate Jahalam in place of Abu Salek. Rather they have done it with good faith and investigated the cases upon relying the evidence produced by the bank officials. As such their act and the investigation and report attracted section 31 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004. He further submits that admittedly Jahalam was implicated wrongly and when the news was published in channel 24 they have promptly and seriously taken into the facts and investigated the matter and thereafter has taken steps to withdraw the prosecution against Jahalam and releasing from the custody. So, the respondent No.1 and their officers have 'no malice to implicate Jahalam. He next submits that the first part of the Rule has already complied and acted upon when Jahalam released from the jail custody. If the question of compensation i.e. the second part of the Rule arises then section 545 of the Code of Criminal Procedure may be applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case.</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
&nbsp; "545(1)—Whenever under any law in force for the time being a Criminal Court imposes a fine or confirms in appeal, revision of otherwise a sentence of fine, or a sentence of which fine forms a part, the Court may, when passing judgment, order the whole or any part of the fine recovered to applied—
<br />(a) in defraying exposses properly incurred in the prosecution;
<br />
&nbsp; (b) in the payment to any person of compensation for any loss or injury caused by the offence, when substantial compensation is, in the opinion of the Court, recoverable by such person in a Civil Court;
<br />
&nbsp; (c) when any person is convicted of any offence which includes theft, criminal misappropriation, criminal breach of trust, or cheating, or of having dishonestly received or retained or, of having voluntarily assisted
<br />
&nbsp; in disposing of, stolen property knowing or having reason to believe the same to be stolen, in compensating any bonafide purchaser, of such property for the loss of the same if such property is restored to the possession of the person entitled thereto.
<br /><br />
&nbsp; (2) If the fine is imposed in a case which is subject to appeal, no such payment shall be made before the period allowed for presenting the appeal has elapsed, or, if an appeal be presented, before the decision of the appeal."
</blockquote>

<p>29. He also submits that the section 31 of the Durnity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 deals with savings and indemnity of Acts done in good faith. Section 31 of the Ain, runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-family: &quot;Noto Sans Bengali&quot;, sans-serif; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
&nbsp; “৩১ সরল বিশ্বাসেকৃত কাজকর্মরক্ষণ __এই আইন বা তদধীন প্রণীত বিধি বা আদেশের অধীন দায়িত্ব পালনকালে সরল বিশ্বাসেকৃত কোন কাজের ফলে কোন ব্যক্তি ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হইলে বা ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হইবার সম্ভাবনা থাকিলে, তজ্জন্য কমিশন, কোন কমিশনার অথবা কমিশনের কোন কর্মকর্তা বা কর্মচারীর বিরুদ্ধে দেওয়ানি বা ফৌজদারি মামলা বা অন্য কোন আইনগত কার্যধারা গ্রহণ করা যাইবেনা ”.......
</blockquote>

<p>30. The learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 further submits that the terms "-sr: has not been defined in the Durnity Daman Commission Ain, 2004. In the General Clauses Act, the terms "good faith" has been defined. Section 3(20) of the General Clauses Act, the word "good faith" has been defined. "Good Faith" means a thing shall be deemed to be done in 'good faith' where it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not. Section 52 of the Penal Code also deals with the definition of "good faith". "Good Faith" means nothing is said to be done or believed in "good faith" which is done or believed without due care and attention.</p>

<p>31. The learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 also submits that the above facts and circumstances of the case, it appears that the act has been done with "good faith" question of malajide or malice does not arise at all. In view of the same until and unless there is any element of malafide or lack of integrity or "good faith" or devotion to duty or honest there is no scope for compensation. He also submits that an act done in "good faith" without intention does not constitute any offence. Any act done in "good faith" with not criminal intention on his part does not render his act blameworthy. An act done in "good faith" without intention does not attract question of compensation. There was no criminal intention on the part of the commission/investigation officer and whatever he decided was in "good faith" and, as such, question of compensation does not arise as at all.</p>

<p>32. The learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 lastly submits that considering the above facts and circumstances and section 31 of the Durnity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 and section 545 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Respondent No.1 may be exsonerated from the Charge of compensation.</p>

<p>33. Mr Shaikh Mohammad Zakir Hossain, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No.8 submits that misappropriation of total amount of Taka 18,47,20,000 from Sonali Bank Limited using 106 cheques was taken place in different period of time between 2009-2010. Thereafter, Sonali Bank Ltd. Lodged an First Information Report in respect of the alleged money on 14-9-2010 under section 420/406 of the Penal Code at Motijheel Police Station being Case No.23(9)10 against Md Abu Salek, Md Mainul Hague staff of Sonali Bank and others. In that First Information Report, Sonali Bank did not mention the name of Jahalam. Thereafter, Sonali Bank also carried out their internal investigation and charge was framed against the staff Mainul Hague on 16-9-2011 and subsequently he was dismissed from his service  on 12-10-2014. Thereafter, the Anti-Corruption Commission took up the case and lodged 33 First Information Report and in those FIR there was no name of Jahalam. He next submits that the Sonali Bank filed a Money Suit No.33 of 2012 before the learned 5th Joint District Judge, Dhaka against 74 respondents for recovery of misappropriation of money. But in the suit the name of Md Jahalam was not made defendant or party.</p>

<p>34. The learned Advocate for the respondent No.8 further submits that the Anti-Corruption Commission after investigation implicated alleged Jahalam @ Md Abu Salek @ Golam Murtaza @ Md Jahalam in the charge-sheet. Jahalam was arrested on 6-2-2016 from the Ghorashal Jute Mills. He submits that implicating in the charge-sheet and arrest of Jahalam, what happened long after the said misappropriation of money of Sonali Bank, and the Sonali Bank have no knowledge of involvement to implicate of Jahalam in those cases of Anti-Corruption Commission and the charge-sheets.</p>

<p>35. Mr Asaduzzaman, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No.10 submits that the respondent No.10 suspended Md Fay sal Kayes and Ms. Sabina Sarmin, two employees of the instant Added Respondent, whose names appeared in the Report. The instant respondent has also issued show cause notices dated 29-7-2019 upon the said officers to explain about their conducts, which have been alleged in the said report dated 30-5-2019. Thereafter, they replied their show cause notice on 6-8-2019.
<br />
&nbsp; The respondent bank framed charge against the employee and thereafter, the respondent No.10 imposed a penalty upon Mr Md Faysal Kayes to stop the salary in payment of next twelve months for the reckless performing job. Thereafter, withdrawal the suspension letter of Ms. Sabina Sharmin vide letter dated 29-7- 2019 and allowed her to resume of her office on the basis of the report of the inquiry committee member who found no direct involvement about the alleged offence.</p>

<p>36. Mr Sameer Satter, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No.13 The City Bank Limited submits that at the initial investigation which left the prosecution of Jahalam none of the employee of respondent No.13 Bank was involved and the Bank is no part of prosecution of Jahalam. He next submits that in the report of the inquiry committee nothing was revealed against the respondent No.13 bank to the prosecute Jahalam and implicating hirn in the place of Abu Salek.</p>

<p>37. We have heard the learned Advocate and perused the records. The affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent Nos.1, 8, 10 and 13 and other documents on records. It appears from the Rule issuing order that learned Advocate Mr Amit Das Gupta, appeared before the court and brought to notice of the Court about a news caption "৩৩ মামলায় ‘ভুল’ আসামী জেল- সার, আমি জাহালম, সালেক না..." published in the 'Daily Prothom Alo' on 28-1-2019. After perusing the news caption of the newspaper and considering the facts and circumstances a Suo-Moto Rule was issued.</p>

<p>38. The first part of the Rule is about the inaction of the respondents in taking necessary steps for releasing innocent Zahalam a labourer of Bangladesh Jute Mills, Ghorashal, Narsingdi in custody for about three years in connection with 33 cases. And the second part of the Rule was about a direction to give appropriate compensa-tion to the victim Zahalam and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.</p>

<p>39. It appears from the affidavits and court's order that the first part of the rule that is the release of Jahalam from the custody was acted upon and he was released on 3-2-2019. Now we have to deal with the second part whether the victim Jahalam is entitled to get compensation for his wrong confinement for about three years in the jail custody.</p>

<p>40. On perusal of the entire affidavit and statements and the report of the inquiry officer, the entire fact has revealed in that report. For proper adjudication and proper disposal of the Rule, we should discuss the relevant part of the inquiry report which are necessary and relates to the rule only.</p>

<p>41. The main question raises in the inquiry report which relates to the terms:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-family: &quot;Noto Sans Bengali&quot;, sans-serif; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">

&nbsp; (গ) ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাদের অন্যান্য ব্যক্তি বা প্রতিষ্ঠানের সংশ্লিষ্টতা নির্ধারণ ও অভিযুক্তকে সনাক্তকারী ব্যক্তিদের চিহ্নিতকরণ এবং তাদের দায়-দায়িত্ব নির্ধারণ,

&nbsp; (ঘ) এ ঘটনা কমিশনের দৃষ্টিগোচর হওয়ার পর জাহালমকে আইনী প্রক্রিয়ায় মুক্ত করতে বিলম্বের কারণ উদ্ঘাটন
</blockquote>

<p>42. In the inquiry report it is found that the investigation officer was appointed by the Commission for investigate the 33 cases and superintendent officer was also appointed named Md Abdullah-al Zahid, Deputy Director (now director). But from the entire facts and circumstances and from the report it appears that the superintendenting authority i.e. Abdullah-Al Zahid, later on transferred to another job could not or did not supervise the investigation process or the investigation officers. It further appears that though the investigation officers were appointed by the Anti-Corruption Commission none of them went to the house of Jahalam for inspection or any inquiry. It is revealed in the inquiry report that all of the investigation officers were newly appointed in the year, 2011 after completing the basic training they have appointed as the investigation officer for the important cases in which they have no earlier experience to investigate and this was the first investigation case in their service life.</p>

<p>43. It is stated in the report that</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-family: &quot;Noto Sans Bengali&quot;, sans-serif; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
&nbsp; “সার্বিক বিবেচনায় আমার নিকট প্রতীয়মান হয়েছে যে, জাহালমকে আবুসালেক রূপে চিহ্নিত করার যে, ভুলটি হয়েছে তা দুদকের তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাদের কারণেই ঘটেছে। আর তাদেরকে ভুল পথে চালিত করতে সহায়তা করেছে ব্র্যাক ব্যাংক ও অন্যান্য ব্যাংকের কর্মকর্তাবৃন্দ এবং একাউন্টের ভুয়া ব্যক্তিকে পরিচয়দানকারীরা। তবে সঠিক ঘটনা তথা সত্য উদ্ঘাটন করে আদালতের নিকট তা উপস্থাপন করাটাই তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাদের দায়িত্ব। এক্ষেত্রে ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাদের ওপর বা অন্য কারোর ওপর এই দায়িত্ব অর্পণ করার কোন সুযোগ নাই। বিশেষ করে তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাদের এটা লক্ষ্য করা উচিত ছিল যে, প্রথমে কিন্তু ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাদের কিংবা একাউন্টের সনাক্তকারীরা আবুসালেককে সনাক্ত করতে কিংবা তাকে খুঁজে বের করতে তৎপর হয়নি। যখন ৩ টি মামলায় (ধানমন্ডি থানা মামলা নং ৯, তারিখঃ ১০-৪-২০১২, শাহ আলী থানা মামলা নং ১৪, তারিখঃ ১০-৪-২০১২ এবং আদাবর থানা মামলা নং ১৫, তারিখঃ ১০-৪-২০১২) চার্জশীট দাখিল করা হয় এবং সেখানে ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাদের আসামী করা হয় তখন তারা বুঝতে পারে যে, মূল আসামী আবুসালেককে খুঁজে বের করে দিতে না পারলে তারা নিশ্চিতভাবেই বাকী মামলাগুলিতে আসামী হয়ে যাবে। তখন তারা মরিয়া হয়ে উঠে। যে কাজটি তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তাদের করা উচিত ছিল সে কাজটি করতে মাঠে নেমে পড়ে ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তারা। তারা যেনতেন প্রকারে একজন আবুসালেককে দুদকের সামনে হাজির করে ও তাকে আবুসালেক রূপে সনাক্ত করে। ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তারা যে নিজেদের বাচাতে যে কোন ব্যক্তিকে আবুসালেক হিসেবে সনাক্ত করতে পারে _ এই সম্ভাবনাটাই তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তারা ভেবে দেখেনি।
<br />
&nbsp; তদারককারীও ব্যর্থ হয়েছেন। এই ৩৩ টি মামলার আইওগণ সিরিয়াস/সঠিকভাবে মামলার তদন্ত করেননি। প্রত্যেকেই একে অন্যের উপর নির্ভরশীল ছিল। প্রত্যেকেই আশায় ছিল অন্যরা তদন্তে কোন অগ্রগতি করলে তারা সেটি কপি করবে এবং সেটিই তারা করেছে। এর মধ্যে শুধু ব্যতিক্রম ছিল সেলিনা আক্তার মনি। শুধুমাত্র সে-ই আবুসালেককে সনাক্ত করা বা খুজে বের করার জন্য তৎপর ছিল। কিন্তু সেও কাজটি নিজে না করে ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাদের দিয়ে সেটি করাতে চেয়েছিল। সে যদি নিজেই আবুসালেককে খোজার জন্য টাঙ্গাইল/শ্যামলীতে যেত (যেটা ফয়সাল কায়েস করেছেন) তবে হয়ত এই ভুলটি হত না। আরও দেখা যাচ্ছে যে, সেলিনা আক্তার মিনির চাপে পড়ে ফয়সাল কায়েস যে ব্যক্তিকে আবুসালেক হিসেবে হাজির করল তাকেই সকল আইও আবু সালেক হিসেবে মেনে নিল।
<br />
&nbsp; এখানে তদারককারীর কোন কার্যকর ভূমিকাই দেখা যাচ্ছে না। এই নবীন ও অনভিজ্ঞ কর্মকর্তারা এ ধরনের ভুল করে যাচ্ছে, একজনের তদন্ত অন্য জন কপি করছে এ বিষয়গুলি তদারককারীর তদারক করা উচিত ছিল। উল্লেখ্য, এই অভিযোগের অনুসন্ধান করে ৩৩ টি মামলা রুজুর সুপারিশ করেছিলেন এবং তিনিই ছিলেন এজাহারকারী। তিনি ছিলেন ব্যুরোর আমলের একজন সিনিয়র কর্মকর্তা। তার উচিত ছিল এই নবীন ও অনভিজ্ঞ কর্মকর্তাদের গাইড করা।
<br />
&nbsp; তদন্তকালে রেকর্ডপত্র ও সংশ্লিষ্ট বক্তব্য পর্যালোচনায় ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাসহ নিম্নবর্ণিত ব্যক্তিবর্গ মোঃ জাহালমকে আবুসালেক হিসেবে সনাক্তকরণের

<p>44. The another paragraph of the report is that Md Faisal Kayes, Officer, Brac Bank Ltd. Mohammadpur SME Brach at present SPO Samoli, Branch, Dhaka went to Duburia of Gunipara, Tangail and also went to the work place of Jahalam and identified him as Abu Salek. Thereafter, on 18-12-2014 he went to the office of the ACC and also identified Jahalam as Abu Salek and also on 10-12-2017 before the Special Judge, Court No.6, Dhaka in Special Case No.11 of 2015 as a witness. Ms. Sabina Sarmin, Branch Manager, Brac Bank Ltd. Mohammadpur SME Branch, at present Branch Manager, Brac Bank Ltd. Samoly Branch, Dhaka instructed Faisal Kayes to go to Tangail and went to Gorashal Jute Mills and identified Jahalam as Abu Salek and also identified at Anti-Corruption Commission office, on 18-12-2014. Another Shahidul Islam, also identified Jahalam as Abu Salek at Anti-Corruption Commission office, Md Nur Uddin Sheikh, identified as Abu Salek at Anti-Corruption Commission, office, Md Shakil, identified as Abu Salek at Anti-Corruption Commission, office and Ms. Tajbin Sultana, Officer Cash, UCBL, Mohamadpur Branch, Dhaka also identified Jahalam as Abu Salek at Anti-Corruption Commission, office on 7-12-2014.</p>

<p>45. From the aforesaid facts and circumstances it appears that the investigation officers were misguided by the aforesaid bank officers and private persons and without going to the home place of Jahalam submitted charge-sheet against Jahalam and accordingly Jahalam was detained in custody for 3(three) years for their wrongful act. Now the question arises whether the victim Jahalam is entitled to get compensation.</p>

<p>46. From the entire documents on records, it appears that Jahalam has no fault of his own. He has wrongly detained for three years and his family members suffered and he has lost his job. So, he is entitled to get compensation. But we have gone through the decision referred to by the learned Advocate from the respondent No.1 and the respondent No.8. The submission of the learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 about section 31 of the Anti-Corruption Commission, Act. We are of the view that the officer of the respondent No.1 has not performed their duty properly which is reveled from the inquiry report also. But we do not see any malqfide intention on the part of the investigation officers of the respondent No.1 from the entire facts and circumstances and the report submitted by the inquiry officer. So, in the facts and circumstances of the case, section 31 of the ACC Act is applicable. Though, they are inefficient, incompetent but we cannot impose any compensation upon the respondent No.1 officials. As we do not see any intention or any malice to implicate Jahalam in place of Abu Salek. But we are of the view, that the Anti-Corruption Commission is a national institution and independent authority formed for prevention of corruption and to act in accordance with law. They have rules and regulation to proceed with the investigaticin and they should be very careful about such false implication of any person in any case in future. So that the public perception at large will be in favour of the Anti-Corruption Commission.</p>

<p>47. Mr Md Khurshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 filed an affidavit-in compliance dated 21-8-2019 wherein it is stated that on 28-7-2019 the High Court Division directed to the respondent No.1 Anti-Corrumption Commission to file an affidavit-in-compliance about the steps regarding the internal inquiry committee report submitted by the inquiry office before the Anti-Corruption Commissison on the next date on 21-8-2019. A letter dated 20-8-2019 being Memo No.00.01.0000.202.18.0249. 32222 signed by the Deputy Director (Legal) sent to the learned Advocate Mr Md Khurshid Alam Khan for taking necessary steps to submit the status of investigation in relates to Suo-Moto Rule No.1 of 2019. On 20-8-2019 a letter signed by the Director (Aministration and Human&nbsp; Ressource) sent to the Director-General (Legal), Anti-Corruption Commission, Head Office, Dhaka and stated that they lodged departmental case against 11 officers as they did not give satisfactory reply in show-cause notice.</p>

<p>48. On 18-8-2019 the Deputy Director (B.Anu.O.Todonto-1) sent another letter vide Memo No. দুদক/বি.অনুঃ ও তদ.-১/মাঃলঃ/ঃ/িস-১৩০/২০১২/৩১৯৭৮ to Directror (Legal) Anti-Corruption Commission stating the present position of the said cases in connection of the Suo Moto Rule No.01 of 2019. On 19-8-2019 Deputy Director, Anti-Corruption Commission, Head Office, Dhaka sent a letter to Director-General (Legal and informed about the latest position of the said case. On 19-8-2019 the Deputy Director, Anti- Corruption Commission and the Investigation Officer sent another letter informing the update position of the said case.</p>

<p>49. Thereafter, the learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 filed another affidavit-in-compliance dated 28-8-2019 wherein it is stated that on 21-8-2019 the High Court Division directed to the respondent No.1 Anti-Corruption Commission to file an affidavit-in-compliance about the particular of the proceedings against the 11 (eleven) officials of the Durnity Daman Commission before this court on 28-8-2019. On 27- 8-2019 the Deptuy Director (Legal) sent a letter being Memo No.00.01.0000.202.18.02.19- 33327 to the learned Advocate Khurshid Alam Khan and informed to take necessary steps for submitting the proceeding of the 11 (eleven) officials of the Durnity Daman Commission before the High Court Division in connection with the Suo Moto Rule No.1 of 2019. On 28-8-2019 Mr Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director (প্রশাসন ও মানবসম্পদ) of the Durnity Daman Commission sent a letter being Memo No.04.01.0000.104. 99.020.19.33229(2) to the Director-General (Legal) of the Durnity Daman Commission, Head office, Dhaka and provided the details of the said 11(eleven) officials of the Durnity Daman Commission.</p>

<p>50. In consideration of the facts and circumstance, we have considered the argument advanced by the learned advocate for the respondent No.8 Sonali Bank Ltd. Though they have no active part and they did not mention the name of Jahalam in the First Information Report and in Money Suit. But from the inquiry report, it appears that the bank officials, specially Brac Bank Ltd. Mr Faisal Kayes and Ms Sabina Sannin, they were very much aware and active to bring and hold Jahalam in place of Abu Salek. Both of them,  Faysal Kayes went to the village of Jahalam and identified him and also identified him at ACC office on 18-12-2014 and also adduced evidence before the court. So, it is apparent, Faysal Kayes is very much active to implicate and to import Jahalam in place of Abu Salek and by this act the investigation officers were misguided and it was revealed from the inquiry committee report. Similarly, Ms. Sabina Sarmin, another Brac Bank official instructed Faysal Kayes to go Tangail and went to the work place of Jahalam at Ghorashal and identified him as Abu Salek and also before the Anti-Corruption Commission, office on 18- 12-2014 and some other person also identified Jahalam as Abu Salek.</p>

<p>51. But from the entire facts and circum-stances and from the inquiry report it appears, that the officials of Brac Bank misguided intentionally to bring into the case Jahalam in place of Abu Salek. In the inquiry report, inquiry officer stated that</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-family: &quot;Noto Sans Bengali&quot;, sans-serif; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
&nbsp; “তারা যেনতেন প্রকারে একজন আবুসালেককে দুদকের সামনে হাজির করে ও তাকে আবুসালেক রূপে সনাক্ত করে। ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তারা যে নিজেদের বাচাতে যে কোন ব্যক্তিকে আবুসালেক হিসেবে সনাক্ত করতে পারে এই সম্ভাবনাটাই তদন্তকারী কর্মকর্তারা ভেবে দেখেননি।”
</blockquote>
<p>So, from the aforesaid facts and circumstances we are of the view that the Brack Bank officials Mr Faisal Kayes and Sabina Sarmin identified Jalalam as Abu Salek. We called for a report with attested photograph of Abu Salek and Jahalam to see open eyes, it appears that any person not necessary an officials and investigation officer that they can identify from the two photograph that they are different person. So, it can be said easily that these bank officials who went to identify Jahalam identified intentionally Jahalam in place of Abu Salek. Earlier stated that the investigation officers were somehow misguided and they ought to have have compare the photograph of Abu Salek and Jahalam. So, on the entire discussion, we are of the view that the vital role was played by the officials of Brac Bank respondent No.10 to falsely implicate Jahalam in this case in place of Abu Salek and respondent No.10 Bank should pay compensation of the aforesaid act of their officers.</p>

<p>52. There have been several instances in Bangladesh where employer was vicariously found liable for the act of the employee in the course of business of the employer. Application of the principles of vicarious  liability is seen in the cases, Catherine Masud vs Md Kashed Min; Bangladesh Beverage Industries vs Rawshan Akio; 69 DLR (AD) 196.</p>

<p>53. So, in consideration of the above facts and circumstances compensation may be awarded in this case. Now the next question how amount of compensation will be assessed this case. In the case of Bangladesh Beverage Industries Ltd. vs Rowshan Akter, 69 DLR (AD) 196, wherein it is observed; " affection, pain, suffering, mental agony, physical incapability an emotion are not calculable and if the court is satisfied that plaintiff is entitled to any compensation that can be only in lump sum and not on calculation". In the case of CCB Foundation vs Government of Bangladesh and others, 5 CLR (HCD) (2017) = 70 DLR 491 the High Court Division goes to observe that; "Quite often the courts have a difficult task in determining damages in various factsituations. The yardstick generally adopted for determining he compensation payable in a suit for damage are not applicable when a constitutional court determines the compensation for violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed to its citizens under Part-III of the Constitution". Another judgment passed by the High Court Division in Suo-Moto Rule No.4 of 2018 wherein observed,</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
&nbsp; "Although the Appellate Division observed that High Court Division will direct the party/parties to pay adequate compensation but question arises how the compensation would be assessed in this writ petition under the constitutional jurisdiction. In this regard we have examined some precedents on similar nature of facts where considering all aspects the court awarded compensation under constitutional jurisdiction".
</blockquote>

<p>54. In consideration of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the respondent No.11 shall pay Taka 15,00,000 (Fifteen lacs) to Jahalam within one month from the date of receipt of the judgment and order and the respondent No.1 is also directed to complete the further investigation as soon as possible and to consider the report filed by the inquiry committee headed by Mr Abdul Wadud and to inquire about the other persons i.e. Md Shahidul Islam, Md Nur Uddin Sheikh, Md Shakil and Ms. Tajbin  Sultana whether they have any involvement in the alleged wrong placing or implicating Jahalam in place of Abu Salek and to proceed, in accordance with law.</p>

<p>55. The respondent No.11 Brae Bank is directed file a compliance about the payment of the compensation money after one week of the end of one month to the Registrar-General, Supreme Court of Bangladesh.
<br />
With the aforesaid findings and observation the Rule is disposed of.</p>

<p>Being directed by the Hon'ble Chief Justice, on behalf of late Justice FRM Nazmul Ahasan signed by me. —KM Kamrul Kader J.</p>

Mr. Justice Muhammad Khurshid Alam Sarkar
Bank Company Matter No. 01 of 2021.

Bangladesh Bank --------- Petitioner
VS
Jubilee Bank Limited and the RJSC ---------- Respondents

Judgement Date : November 29, 2021 
Tanjib-ul Alam with Kazi Ershadul Alam, Advocates -------For the PetitionerAbdul Wahab, Deputy Attorney-General -------For the State.AKM Badruddoza ------For the RJSC.

Judgment
This is an application under section 65 of the Banking Companies Act, 1991 (briefly, the Banking Companies Act), at the instance of petitioner- Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of Bangladesh and a body corporate established under the Bangladesh Bank Order, 1972 (President's Order No. 127 of 1972), having its office at Bangladesh Bank Bhaban, Motijheel C/A, Dhaka-1000 represented by its Governor, seeking winding up of Jubilee Bank Limited (shortly, Jubilee Bank), a banking company incorporated under the Companies Act, having its registered office at Kaziuddin Tower (6th Floor), 176, Shoheed Syed Nazrul Islam Sarak, Bijoynagar, Dhaka with its Head Office at Janipur Bazar, Khoksha, Kushtia.

2. It is stated that Jubilee Bank was incorporated in 1913 as a company limited by shares and, thereafter, Bangladesh Bank issued a license under section 27(2) of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 (shortly, Banking Ordinance), in favour of the Jubilee Bank dated 25-6-1984 permitting it to conduct business as a non-scheduled bank under the terms and conditions that it shall permanently follow and observe the provisions of the Banking Ordinance and Rules and Regulations made thereunder, and Directives issued by Bangladesh Bank from time to time. As per Clause 5 of the license issued by the petitioner to the Jubilee Bank, it is required to maintain an amount equivalent to 2 (two) percent of its time liability and 5 (five) percent of its demand liabilities in cash as cash reserve and, as per the Clause 2 of the license, Jubilee Bank was required to confine its loan operation to gold loan only. Subsequently, by a letter dated 26-11-1984, Bangladesh Bank gave permission to the Jubilee Bank to lend an amount not exceeding Taka 25,000 to small borrowers of all types viz. small traders, cottage industries and small farmers. Following enactment of the Banking Companies Act, by its section 13, Bangladesh Bank has been conferred power to determine conditions relating to maintaining paid-up capital and reserve fund by the banking companies. In exercise of such power, Bangladesh Bank issued a Gazette Notification on 12- 8-2008 requiring all the Banking Companies to increase their paid-up capital and reserve fund to BDT 400 crores in which paid-up capital shall be at least BDT 200 crores and achieve the same within 3 years from the date of publication of the Gazette Notification. Bangladesh Bank also circulated a letter dated 14-8- 2008 bearing BRPD Circular No. 11 asking all the Banking Companies operating in Bangladesh, including Jubilee Bank, for fulfilling the requirement under the said Gazette Notification. When Jubilee Bank failed to comply with the aforesaid requirement, Bangladesh Bank issued a letter dated 14-1-2021 directing Jubilee Bank to refrain from accepting new deposits and disbursing and granting new loans. Jubilee Bank did not reply to the said letter, but, some persons claiming to be the shareholders of Jubilee Bank informed their inability to increase the paid-up capital to Taka 200 crores and requested permission from Bangladesh Bank to continue accepting new deposits and providing new loans.

3. It is averred in the petition that Jubilee Bank did not apply for a license as of today under section 31 of the Banking Companies Act and when in the year 2018, the Bangladesh Bank conducted a special inspection of Jubilee Bank, it was found that Jubilee Bank had been lending money to most of its clients exceeding the ceiling of BDT 25,000; had lent BDT 3,000,000 to one individual client namely Ms. Hazera Chowdhury (CC Loan Account No. 54) which was more than ten times of the approved loan limit; had
failed to maintain cash reserve fund to comply with Clause 5 of the License; had also failed to maintain its Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) till date and failed to comply with Clause 7 of the license; did not have any valid board and it was also doubtful as to who were the shareholders of this Banking Company, as there was no information with regard to chain of ownership of shares and the persons claiming to be shareholders did not possess any Share Certificate or Articles of Association and Memorandum of Association of Jubilee Bank; had also failed to provide evidence to the effect that the purported Board of Directors had obtained approval from Bangladesh Bank under section 15(5) of the Banking Companies Act. Since Bangladesh Bank has found in its inspection report that Jubilee Bank is being operated without complying with most of the banking standards and most of the loans provided by the Bank are categorized as harmful by the petitioner, therefore, allowing Jubilee Bank to be in operation would be against the interest of the depositors of the said Bank. Hence, this application.

4. Upon admission of the matter on 18-5-2021 by this Court, the usual notices were published in two newspapers and affidavit-in-compliance was duly filed on 7-6-2021 by the petitioner-Bangladesh Bank, as evident from annexures, J series to the said affidavit-in-compliance. No Vokalatnama has been filed by any stakeholder or interested person/entity despite publication of the notice of admission of the instant case in two daily national newspapers, in addition to serving notices upon the respondents by the registered posts. Thereafter, when the matter was appearing in the Cause List for a few consecutive days, none appeared before this Court to contest the case. Under the circumstances, this Court considered it appropriate to proceed with disposal of the case exparte on the basis of the averments made in the petition together with its annexures and the submissions made by Mr Tanjib-ul Alam, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner-Bangladesh Bank.

5. Since Mr Tanjib-ul Alam's most of the submissions are centered around the averments made in the petition, which are already stated hereinbefore, this Court refrains from recording the same for the sake of brevity. And, the additional submissions he has made with reference to the Order dated 4-2-2020 passed by this Court in the Company Matter No. 315 of 2017, which was filed by some persons claiming themselves to be the shareholders of Jubilee Bank, shall be dealt with by this Court now, for the reasons to be revealed hereinafter, in advance to the issues arising out of the statements made in the petition.

6. There is a chequered history behind passing the Order dated 4-2-2020 by this Court in the Company Matter No. 315 of 2017. Given that the background facts of the aforesaid Order have been reported in the 18 ALB (2020) at page 91 (Md Shahid Ullah vs Jubilee Bank), this Court, without repeating the same, merely reproduces the Directions made therein; (i)The Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) is directed to strike off the name of the Jubilee Bank Ltd from its Record/Register upon complying with the relevant provisions of section 346 of the Companies Act. (ii)The Governor of Bangladesh Bank is directed to inform this Court as to who were the responsible officials (i.e. Governor/s, Deputy Governor/s, Executive Director/s, Director/s, General Manager/s, Deputy General Manager/s and other officers) for monitoring the activities of this company, from the date of issuance of its license dated 25-6-1984 till date and, whether they have ever been asked by the Governor or any other high-ranking official to show cause as to their failure to carry out their respective legal duties. (iii)Why the Bangladesh Bank did not come up with an application for winding up of this banking company.

7. By filing a Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal (CPLA No. 837 of 2020) before the Hon'ble Appellate Division, the Bangladesh Bank challenged the above-quoted Directions and, after hearing the learned Advocate for the Bangladesh Bank Mr Tanjib-ul Alam, the Hon'ble Appellate Division dismissed the said CPLA and asked the Bangladesh Bank to comply with the Directions quoted above. Thereafter, when Mr Tanjib-ul Alam appeared before this Court for admission of the instant matter, this Court asked the learned
Advocate for the petitioner as to the grounds for challenging the aforesaid Order and, in reply thereto, he informed this Court that he was instructed by one of the Executive Directors of Bangladesh Bank, named Mr Shah Alam to get the said Order set-aside, so that Jubilee Bank could continue to be in operation. Till date, Bangladesh Bank has not complied with the above-quoted Direction Nos. (ii) & (iii) passed in the Company Matter No. 315 of 2017. Had these quoted Directions been complied with by the Bangladesh

Bank, by now, this Court might have been in a position to unearth the previous activities of Jubilee Bank. It is the utmost duty of all the State-functionaries as well as all the Government and non-Government institutions of this country to detect not only the locations of the killers of the Father of the Nation, but also to trace out their assets, so that the same may be confiscated as a course of execution of the sentence and conviction passed by the Apex Court of the land in the case of Major Bazlul Huda and others vs State 62 DLR (AD) I. In the light of the fact that it has been admitted by the petitioners of the Company Matter
No. 315 of 2017 that the killers of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were the majority shareholders of Jubilee Bank, it was a solemn duty of the Bangladesh Bank to dig out all the previous transactions of Jubilee Bank aiming at tracking down siphoning off money to any foreign countries, which they might have done immediately after or before leaving Bangladesh.

8. However, the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) opted not to challenge the said Order dated 4-2-2020 as the said office was convinced that the name of Jubilee Bank Ltd was liable to be striken off long ago, for, it was the statutory duty of the RJSC under section 346(3) of the Companies Act to proceed with striking off the name of the incorporated company (i.e. Jubilee Bank Ltd) upon exhausting the procedures set out in sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 346 of the Companies Act when the killers of the Father of the Nation fled away from Bangladesh in the year 1996 abandoning all their businesses and properties, including the shares they were holding in Jubilee Bank Ltd. It is the trite law that when the RJSC has the reason/s to believe that an incorporated company is not carrying out its business (the reason behind RJSC's such belief might be generated from an incorporated company's failure to submit its Returns within the statutory period, such as; Schedule X, Form XII, etc following completion of the AGM for each of the calendar year, or from an inspection report of the company in question, or through any other information) and, pursuant thereto, by invoking section 346(1) of the Companies Act, the RJSC sends a letter to the said incorporated company by post with an enquiry as to whether the company is carrying on its business or not and, thereafter, RJSC's second letter sent under section 346(2) by registered post within fourteen days of expiration of sending the first letter remains unheeded, it becomes a legal obligation on part of the RJSC to strike off the name of the company in question towards its dissolution and, thereafter, to publish the same in the Gazette Notification.

9. Given that it is a publicly known fact that Major (dismissed) Rashid and other assassins of the Father of the Nation are either absconding or dead since the year 1996, the statutory duty of the RJSC to issue notice under section 346(1) had become due long ago. However, even at a belated stage, since the RJSC has found it to be an appropriate case to proceed with striking off the name of Jubilee Bank under section 346 of the Companies Act and, after duly observing the procedures as laid down in section 346 of the Companies Act, the RJSC has struck off the name of the Jubilee Bank from the record maintained by the RJSC and also has already published a Gazette Notification on 25-3-2021 in accordance with section 346(5) of the Companies Act, Jubilee Bank has been dissolved with effect from 25-3-2021 and, as such, Jubilee Bank does not have any capacity to continue any business, let alone the banking business. In fact, after striking off the Jubilee Bank's name from the record of the RJSC, there is no existence of a company in the name and style of 'Jubilee Bank Ltd’.

10. Nevertheless, since the petitioner-Bangladesh Bank has come up with the instant application, albeit belatedly, invoking section 65 of the Banking Companies Act, now, the task that has been devolved upon this Court is to see whether the stated facts and circumstances of this case fit in with the relevant provisions of law, namely, section 65 of the Banking Companies Act to pass an Order of winding up of the Jubilee Bank Ltd (respondent No. 1-Company). Section 65 of the Bank Companies Act runs as follows:

65. Winding up by High Court (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in sections 153, 162 and 271 of the Companies Act, and without prejudice to the powers given under sub-section (1) of section 64, the High Court Division shall under this section order the winding up of a banking, company, if— a) the banking company is unable to pay its debts; b) the Bangladesh Bank makes an application for its winding up under this section or section 64. (2)-----------
(3) The Bangladesh Bank may make an application under this section for the winding up of a banking company, -- a)if the banking company i)has failed to comply with the requirements specified under section 13; or ii)has by reasons of the provisions of section 31 become disentitled to carry on banking business in Bangladesh; iii)-------------- b)-------------- i)------------- ii) the continuance of the banking company is prejudicial to the interests of its depositors.

11. From a plain reading of section 65 of the Banking Companies Act, it is vividly clear that it is an obligatory onerous task of the High Court Division to pass an Order for winding up of a Banking Company if the Bangladesh Bank can satisfy this Court that it has filed the winding up application on any of the grounds enunciated in sub-section (3) of section 65 of the Banking Companies Act.

12. Section 13 of the Banking Companies Act requires every Banking company conducting its business in Bangladesh to maintain a minimum capital along with reserve fund as to be fixed by the Bangladesh from time to time, and the said minimum capital along with the reserve fund having been fixed by the Bangladesh Bank currently at Taka 400 (four) hundred crores out of which Taka 200 (two hundred) crores must be the paid-up capital, no Bank Company shall be permitted to carry on its business in Bangladesh unless it maintains a reserve fund of Taka 400 (four hundred) crores which shall include 200 (four hundred) crores paid-up capital at the minimum.

13. Furthermore, section 31 of the Banking Companies Act imposes prohibition on any company or any person to conduct banking business without first being issued with a license by the Bangladesh Bank for that purpose.

14. Since it is evident from the annexed papers that Jubilee Bank has clearly failed to comply with the requirements of maintaining a reserve fund of Taka 400 (four hundred) crores and, consequently, it has violated section 13 of the Banking Companies Act and, also, since Jubilee Bank has not applied for a license within the prescribed time limit as per section 31 of the Banking Companies Act, Jubilee Bank has become disentitled to continue banking business in Bangladesh and, further, as there is no active Board of Directors in Jubilee Bank, the savings of the depositors in the Jubilee Bank are in question and such a situation cannot be continued in the interest of the depositors of the Jubilee Bank. Therefore, it is the considered view of this Court that the said Bank should not be allowed to be continued. Thus, Jubilee Bank is liable to be wound up under section 65(3)(a)(i)&(ii) and also under section 63(3)(b)(iii) of the Banking Companies Act. Hence, I find the instant application to be a fit one for winding up of Jubilee Bank. And, consequently, it has been obligatory for this Court to pass necessary consequential and supplementary Orders and Directions invoking relevant provisions of the Companies Act, towards finally dissolving the Jubilee Bank. It is to be jotted down here for information of all the concerned that since the Banking Companies Act, by making a statement in its section 2, recognizes the provisions of the Companies Act to be the additional law of the Banking Companies Act, the provisions of the Companies Act shall be applied in aid to the provisions of the Banking Companies Act. And, in practice as well, in course of winding up of a Banking Company under section 65 of the Banking Companies Act, a Banking Company cannot be fully and effectively wound up towards its final dissolution without having recourse to the various provisions of the Companies Act.

15. In the result, this application under section 65 of the Banking Companies Act is allowed and the respondent No.1-company, namely, Jubilee Bank Limited, is hereby wound up from the date this petition has been presented i.e from 9-5-2021, with the following Directions and Orders; (1) Since Bangladesh Bank has not proposed any name as the Official Liquidator of the Jubilee Bank Ltd

Judgment
Md Nazrul Islam Talukder, J:

On an application under section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this Rule, at the instance of the petitioner, was issued calling upon the opposite-parties to show cause as to why the petitioner should not be granted anticipatory bail till submission of the police report if any, after such investigation as reported and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.

2. It may be noted that at the time issuance of the Rule, the petitioner was admitted to anticipatory bail till submission of the police report after investigation, if any, as it reported in the newspaper on executing a bond at the satisfaction of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka.

3. Being aggrieved by the same, the Anti-Corruption Commission preferred Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.7105 of 2017 before the Appellate Division and the learned Judges of the Appellate Division by judgment and order dated 24-7-2017 disposed of the appeal allowing the petitioner to remain on anticipatory bail till disposal of Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.28743 of 2017 as well as directing the High Court Division to dispose of the aforesaid criminal miscellaneous case on merit as expeditiously as possible.

4.

The facts leading up to issuance of the Rule are as follows: —
It is stated that in the application that the petitioner was enrolled in the High Court of the then East Pakistan as an Advocate on 21-3-1969 and continued his career as a practicing lawyer before the High Court Division of Bangladesh since then. Subsequently, the petitioner became enrolled in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh as an Advocate on 25-4-1980. Thereafter the petitioner was chosen to be elevated as a Judge of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on 1-6- 1996. Thereafter, the petitioner was also elevated as a Judge of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the year 2004 and went into retirement therefrom on 1-1-2010 as a Judge of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. It is stated that soon after the petitioner laid down his robe, Respondent No.2 Anti-Corruption Commission (hereinafter referred to as the ACC) by a letter dated 18-7- 2010 asked the petitioner to submit a statement in respect of his properties and assets. The petitioner accordingly submitted his statement of properties and assets on 8-8-2010 to the ACC. Thereafter by a further notice dated 25-10-2010, the said Commission asked for further statement and following the same, he submitted further statement of properties on 3-11-2010. The ACC found no cause to move against the petitioner for long 6 (six) years. After long 6 (six) years of silence, the ACC asked the petitioner to attend its office and furnish further statements of properties and assets by way of further clarification of his
earlier statements. The petitioner also complied with the same.
5. Following the news report published in the "Daily Janakantha" on the 5th and 7th June 2017, he came to know that the ACC is trying to arrest the petitioner immediately before filing of this FIR by dint of section 21 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004.

6. And thereby being aggrieved by the said news report published in "The Daily Janakantha", the petitioner approached this Court with an application under section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for anticipatory bail and obtained this Rule along with ad-interim anticipatory bail till submission of the police report if any after the investigation.

7. At the very outset, Mr Moinul Hossain, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner, submits that the petitioner is a retired judge of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and an old man of 74 years and it is not quite necessary to harass and humiliate him by the way adopted by the Commission and, as such, the petitioner may be entitled to be directed to remain on anticipatory bail until the charge-sheet is filed.

8. He next submits that the petitioner being a responsible citizen and a retired judge of the highest court is ready to face the case if any and that he will not misuse the order of anticipatory bail in any manner.

9. He then submits that it will be an abuse of power and disrespect to judge of the highest court to allow the police/ACC to arrest him though he is promise bound to surrender before the concerned court as and when the charge-sheet if any is filed.

10. He candidly submits that if the petitioner is enlarged on anticipatory bail making the Rule absolute, there is no chance of his absconding or tampering with the evidence and that he will not abuse or misuse the privilege of bail in any manner.

11. He vigorously submits that the Anti-Corruption Commission being empowered by section 21 of the ACC Act, 2004 may arrest any person who has acquired or is in possession of any movable or immovable property disproportionate to his declared sources of income and, as such, the accused petitioner may be allowed to remain on anticipatory bail making the Rule absolute.

12. He lastly submits that no FIR has yet been lodged, but the petitioner is apprehending that he may be arrested by the police/ACC in the name of so-called enquiry as it is reported in the newspaper and in that case, he will be harassed and humiliated and to avoid such harassment, he requires protection of the Court.

13. On the other hand, Mr Khurshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate, appearing for the Anti-Corruption Commission, vehemently opposes the Rule and categorically submits that no case has been initiated by lodging FIR against the petitioner and, as such, in the absence of any case, there is no reasonable apprehension of arrest, harassment and humiliation in a pending enquiry if any and that for granting anticipatory bail, there must be a case against the petitioner and mere apprehension of harassment and humiliation in the absence of any case cannot be taken into consideration for allowing the prayer for anticipatory bail by making the Rule absolute.

14. He next submits that for hearing the case of Durnity Daman Commission, there are some specific benches of High Court Division to hear and dispose of the application relating to Durnity Daman Commission but the Rule issuing bench had no jurisdiction to hear and dispose of any application of the cases of Durnity Daman Commission but the learned judges of that bench going beyond the jurisdiction enlarged the petitioner on anticipatory bail till submission of the police report and accordingly the Rule along with the ad-interim order of anticipatory bail suffers from lack of jurisdiction of the court which issued the same.

15. In contrast to the aforesaid submissions of the learned Advocate for the ACC, Mr Hossain submits that it is true that no case has yet been filed/started but the fact remains that there is no bar to giving protection to the petitioner by granting anticipatory bail if there are bona fide reasons to grant the same.

16. We have gone through the application for anticipatory bail and perused the materials annexed therewith. We have also heard the learned Advocates for the respective parties and the learned Deputy

Attorney-General for the State.

17. Since the learned Advocates for the respective parties have made elaborate submissions and counter submissions on anticipatory bail with reference to many legal decisions, we want to discuss a little bit about the concept of anticipatory bail before coming to a decision in this Rtile.

18. It may be noted that pre-arrest bail or anticipatory bail is an extraordinary relief which can be granted only in extraordinary or exceptional circumstances upon a proper exercise of the discretion of the Court. There is no specific provision or section in our Code of Criminal Procedure underlying the direction and for exercising the power under section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Unlike section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Indian jurisdiction, there is no such provision or law in our Code of Criminal Procedure under which the pre-arrest bail under section 498 can be granted. The concept of anticipatory bail in this country has been developed by the pronouncement of different judgments by the Courts time to time. The concept of granting anticipatory bail was initially raised and discussed in the case of The Crown vs Khushi Muhammad reported in 5 DLR (Er) 86, wherefrom we find that a case was filed against one Khushi Muhammad under section 366 of the Penal Code out of a faction inimical relationship. Khusi Mohammad, a respectable man, apprehended that he would soon be taken into custody by the police. Being aggrieved by the same, he submitted an application for pre-arrest bail before the learned Sessions Judge alleging, inter-alia, that he may be released on bail pending investigation and trial if any considering the circumstances and apprehension of arrest but the bail was rejected by the learned Sessions Judge by the following order which runs as follows: "This is an application on behalf of Khushi Muhammad for bail in anticipation of his possibly being arrested for the offence punishable under section 366, PPC. His learned Advocate has argued that the case against him will prima facie be a weak one, but that is not enough for the grant of an order of this nature. He entirely failed to satisfy me that if the petitioner were to be arrested and refused bail, such an order would in all probability be made not from motives of furthering the ends of justice in relation to the case, but for some ulterior motive and with the object to injure the petitioner, or that the petitioner would in such an eventuality suffer irreparable loss. I, therefore, reject this petition."

19. After his petition had been dismissed by the Sessions Judge, Khushi Muhammad waited for a fortnight and then presented a petition in the High Court. The contents of which are practically identical with the petition presented by him in the Court of Sessions Judge.

20. Upon hearing the parties, Mr Justice Kayani, the learned judge of High Court observed that "As I have pointed out above, the High Court has power to "direct that any person be admitted to bail.", and giving these words their full weight, I see no escape from the conclusion that the power extends not only to the grant of bail to persons who are in the custody of the High Court or of an inferior Court or a police officer but also includes a power to give directions that persons should be admitted to bail who are not in custody."

21. Due to divergence of judicial opinion on this question and against the decision of High Court, the Crown presented a petition for special leave to appeal before the federal court and then leave was granted.

22. Upon hearing the parties, the Federal Court allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment of High Court and held that a person cannot be admitted to bail against whom a report or FIR has been lodged at the police station but who has not been placed in custody or under any other form of restraint or against whom no warrant of arrest has been issued.

23. Subsequently, in that regard, a lenient view was taken by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Sadiq Ali vs the State reported in PLD 1996 SC 589, where it was held that for the grant of bail to a person whose arrest on a criminal charge by police without a warrant is proved to be imminent and certain and where the circumstances would justify the grant of bail.

24. Later on, the above view was further extended in new dimension in the case of Shah Zillur Rahman vs The State reported in PLD (1959) Dhaka 192, wherein the question of granting anticipatory bail was exhaustively considered by the learned judges and it was decided that on principle it is true that in case of concurrent jurisdiction the lower court should be moved first but it is not a hidebound Rule.

25. At a later date, in the case of Zahoor Ahmed and in the case of Zahoor Ahmed vs State, reported in PLD 1974 Lahore 256, the question of granting anticipatory bail was exhaustively considered and it was held that in exceptional circumstances, an application for anticipatory bail may also be moved before the higher court.

26. Eventually, in the case of Muhammad Ayub vs Muhammad Yaqub reported in PLD 1966 SC 1003 = 1.9 DLR (SC) 38, the learned judges examined the true nature and scope of section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and it was decided that section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is ancillary and subsidiary to the provisions of sections 496 and 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that granting anticipatory bail under section 498 may be construed to extend that the power of High Court Division or the court of sessions to grant bail even in cases where these courts would not be competent to grant bail under section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

27. Now it is well settled that our High Court Division or the Court of Sessions can exercise the power under section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure where the perception of the Court is that a proceeding that has been lodged against the accused is for ulterior motive either political or otherwise for harassing the accused and not for securing the justice, or to achieve a collateral purpose for harassment or humiliation.

28. The concept of granting anticipatory bail was elaborately and exhaustively discussed in the case of the State vs Abdul Wahab Shah Chowdhury, reported in 51 DLR (AD) 243, wherefrom it is abundantly clear that pre-arrest bail is an extra-ordinary remedy, an exception to the general law of bail, can be granted only in extra-ordinary and exceptional circumstances upon proper and intelligible exercise of discretion. Anyway, the anticipatory bail may be granted to an accused on the following grounds and circumstances: 1) Where a person is unnecessarily harassed or disturbed due to any motive of political victimization or otherwise by starting a malicious prosecution. 2) Where a person is physically incapable to go to the lower Court concerned for seeking bail due to serious illness or bodily infirmity to travel a long distance and in that circumstances he can move the High Court Division. 3) Where an accused does not feel secure to appear before lower Court due to volatile public sentiment which is not congenial for his appearance before the lower Court he may move the High Court Division directly. 4) When there are other exceptional circumstances for granting anticipatory bail, the petitioner may come before this Court for anticipatory bail.

29.

In the case of State vs Zakaria Pilau reported in 31 BLD (AD) 20 = 62 DLR (AD) 420, the essentialities for the anticipatory bail are as follows: — i)Assumption of jurisdiction to consider anticipatory bail is an extra-ordinary one. ii)Discretion of the High Court Division in granting bail, very wide though, must be encompassed by judicial circumspection based on established legal principles, without resorting to arbitrary consideration. iii)The Judges concerned must go through the FIR meticulously and it must be reflected in their order that they have thoroughly scanned the facts and the allegations scripted in the FIR. iv)Sometimes it is imperative on the part of the Court to refuse pre-arrest-bail when allegations against the petitioners are of serious nature, because the Court must always nurture in their introspection that justice must eventually be done by ensuring punishment for the offenders, as otherwise the fabrics of the civilized society will crumble. v)The Judges must not be oblivious of the interest of the victims and the society as a whole, for justice connotes even handedness. vi)Anticipatory bail application must be considered in the backdrop of the possibility that investigation
process, in consequence of enlarging the accused on bail, may be impeded. vii)Prevailing situation should not be ignored.
30. The aforesaid view was re-echoed in the decision taken in the case of Durnity Daman Commission and another vs Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and another reported in 66 DLR (AD) 92, wherein it was clearly held as under: - 1) Anticipatory bails shall not survive post charge-sheet stage. 2) An omnibus statement that he is a political personage and the Magistrates or the lower court/tribunal Judges, as the case may be, are controlled by the government (which has neither factual nor legal basis these days) is not enough. Equally well, the Judges of the High Court Division concerned must also assign reason for their satisfaction on this primordial point, which must be reckoned to be the door opener. 3) To open the jurisdictional door they shall satisfy themselves that reasons for apprehension have specifically, explicitly, plausibly, credibly and with sufficient clarity been assigned, instead of relying on any generalized pretension. That must be treated as the precursor. 4) Political threshold of the petitioner or claim rivalry by itself without further ado shall not be ground for entertaining an application. 5) Non-availability of the offence cited in the FIR cannot be reason for High Court Division's intervention for even the Magistrate/lower court/tribunal judges are competent enough to enlarge on bail a person accused of non-bailable offences in discovering cases. 6) Effect of the accused freedom on the investigation process must not be allowed to obfuscation. 7) The High Court Division must scrutinize the text in the FIR with expected diligence and the allegations are heinous in nature and keeping in mind the ordains figured and the paragraphs reported in 51 DLR (AD) 242. 8) Interest of the victim in particular and the society at large must be taken into account in weighing in respective rights. 9) If satisfied in all respects, the High Court Division shall dispose of the application instantaneously by enlarging the accused on a limited bail, not normally exceeding four weeks, without issuing any Rule. It must be conspicuously stated in the bail granting order that in the event of any filance of bail application, the Court below will consider the same using its own legal discretion without reference to the High Court Division's anticipatory bail order.

31. In the case of Gurbakash Singh vs State of Punjab, reported in AIR 1980 SC 1632, it was held as follows: - firstly, section 438(1) of the Code lays down a condition which has to be satisfied before anticipatory bail can be granted. The applicant must show that he has 'reason to believe' that he may be arrested for a non bailable offence. The use of the expression `reason to believe' shows that the belief that the applicant may be so arrested must be founded on reasonable grounds. Mere 'fear' is not 'belief' for which reason it is not enough for the applicant to show that he has some sort of a vague apprehension that someone is going to make an accusation against him, in pursuance of which he may be arrested. The grounds on which the belief of the applicant is based that he may be arrested for a non-bailable offence, must be capable of being examined by the Court objectively, because it is then alone that the Court can determine whether the applicant has reason to believe that he may be so arrested. Section 438(1), therefore, cannot be invoked on the basis of vague and general allegations, as if to arm oneself in perpetuity against a possible arrest. Otherwise, the number of applications for anticipatory bail will be as large as, at any rate, the adult populace. Anticipatory bail is a device to secure the individual's liberty; it is neither a passport to the Commission of crimes nor a shield against any and all kinds of accusations, likely or unlikely. secondly, if an application for anticipatory bail is made to the High Court or the Court of Sessions it must apply its own mind to the question and decide whether a case has been made out for granting such relief.

It cannot leave the question for the decision of the Magistrate concerned under section 437 of the Code, as and when, an occasion arises. Such a course will defeat the very object of section 438. thirdly, the filing of a First Information Report is not a condition precedent to the exercise of the power under section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure rather the imminence of a likely arrest founded on a reasonable belief can be shown to exist even if an FIR is not yet filed. fourthly, Anticipatory bail can be granted even after the FIR is filed, so long as the applicant has not been arrested. fifthly, the provisions of section 438 cannot be invoked after the arrest of the accused. The grant of "anticipatory bail" to an accused who is under arrest involves a contradiction in terms, in so far as the offence or offences for which he is arrested, are concerned. After arrest, the accused must seek his remedy under section 437 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or section 439 of the Code, if he wants to be released on bail in respect of the offence or offences for which he is arrested.

32. We have stated earlier that the learned Advocates for the respective parties, in support of their submissions and contentions, have referred to many legal decisions taken in the cases of The Crown vs Khushi Muhammad reported in 5 DLR (FC) 86, Sadiq Ali vs the State reported in PLD 1996 SC 589, Shah Zillur Rahman vs The State reported in PLD (1959) Dhaka 192, Zahoor Ahmed and in the case of Zahoor Ahmed vs State, reported in PLD 1974 Lahore 256, Muhammad Ayub vs Muhammad Yaqub reported in PLD (1966) SC 1003 = 19 DLR (SC) 38, The State vs Abdul Wahab Shah Chowdhury, reported in 51 DLR (AD) 243, State vs Zakaria Pintu reported in 31 BLD (AD) 20 = 62 DLR (AD) 420, Durnity Daman Commission and another vs Dr. Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and another reported in 66 DLR (AD) 92, Gurbakash Singh vs State of Punjab, reported in AIR (1980) SC 1632.

33. We have meticulously examined and perused the decisions referred to by the learned Advocate for the petitioner and the learned Advocate for the Anti-Corruption Commission. It appears that some of the cases cited before us were discussed in the reported case of The State vs Abdul Wahab Shah Chowdhury, reported in 51 DLR (AD) 243. On going through all the decisions of our jurisdiction and other jurisdiction, we do find that the anticipatory bail has been granted to persons against whom a case has been filed either mentioning or without mentioning the name of those persons. The apprehension of the petitioner is that the petitioner may be arrested in connection with the enquiry under section 21 of the Anti Corruption Commission Act, 2004 since the news report was published in the "The Daily Janakantha" for holding investigation into the alleged amassed wealth of the petitioner, which is claimed to be disproportionate to his known source of the income. The further apprehension of the petitioner, after publication of the newspaper reports in the "The Daily Janakantha" is that the petitioner is a responsible citizen and a retired judge of the highest court and if the petitioner is arrested, it will cause harassment and humiliation to the petitioner.

34. In this regard, we want to speak something about the role of our newspaper. It is worthwhile to mention that newspaper is a printed publication media which contains different news and articles on various subjects. Newspapers play an important role in democracy to take the role of spokesman for people of all classes. They act as a bridge between the government and the people. They help in preventing social exploitation that can threaten the existence of democracy.

35. In a democracy, there should be an efficient and fearless press to act as watchdog of democracy. Newspapers make people aware of every field of society. In the present age, corruption is present in all walks of life. Newspapers play an important role in highlighting the menace of corruption and thereby the people are made aware of the corrupt practices if any prevalent in various departments and agencies of government and other private organizations.

36. But of course, yellow Journalism is always disapproved, discarded and not appreciated at all. Newspaper should concentrate on giving only the true picture of the society.

37. It is worthwhile to mention that yellow journalism means and includes exaggeration of news reports, scandal mongering, sensationalism created and published by unprofessional and unethical fashion, eye catching headlines of news reports for increased sales of newspapers, which are not legitimated and well researched news without proper support and justification and news report without verifying its truth and
accuracy etc.

38. The "Daily Janakantha" is one of the leading Bengali-language daily newspaper in the country. It is also the largest circulating newspaper in the country. They published the news reports under caption "সাবেক বিচারপতির দূর্নীতি তদন্তে সুপ্রীম কোর্ট প্রশাসনের বাধা" and "সাবেক বিচারপতির তদন্তে থেমে নেই দুদুক", which have been annexed in the application for anticipatory bail.

39. We have gone through the contents of the news reports. On a plain reading of the news reports, we do not find any reference of any officer of the Anti-Corruption Commission or the police, who have divulged anything about the steps to arrest or harass or humiliate the petitioner during pendency of the enquiry. They just only published the newspaper reports in "The Daily Janakantha" getting news from the Anti-Corruption Commission. And the journalists of "The Daily Janakantha" as part of their duty and responsibility, published the news reports with a view to bringing this matter to the notice of the people and authorities by which it cannot be said that it has created an apprehension of arrest by the Durnity Daman Commission under section 21 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004. Section 21 of the Anti Corruption Commission Act, 2004 is a statutory law by which the Anti-Corruption Commission, with the approval of the court, may arrest any person, when there is a bona fide reason to believe that a person has acquired or is in possession, in his own name or in the name of any other person, any movable or immovable property disproportionate to his declared sources of income. This section is not only applicable to the petitioner rather it is applicable to all the people. Many cases are filed against the person or accused in this country. So because of the statutory section 21 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004, it cannot be said that there is an apprehension of arrest of the petitioner and he will be arrested pursuant to the publication of newspaper reports in "The Daily Janakantha".

40. It is stated in the application that on 18-7-2010, the petitioner received the notice from the Anti Corruption Commission for submitting wealth-statement and having received the same, he submitted wealth-statement on 8-8-2010. Upon receiving the further notice from the Anti-Corruption Commission, he submitted further statement of properties on 3-11-2010. But since then no step for arresting the petitioner has been taken as yet. Besides this scenario, the Anti-Corruption Commission has not taken any approval from the court with a view to arresting the petitioner. Moreover, being aggrieved by the notice of ACC for submitting wealth-statements, the petitioner filed writ petition before the High Court Division but the same was rejected as being not pressed. In spite of aforesaid fact, the ACC/Police did not take any steps to arrest him. Under the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the apprehension of arrest of the petitioner as disclosed in the application is not plausible and credible since the same was not explained with sufficient clarity and the apprehension was explained relying on generalized pretension.

41. From the reported cases, it is found that all the cases were filed either mentioning or non-mentioning the name of the persons/accused. But in the instant case in hands, not a single case has been filed against the petitioner and the ad-interim bail has been granted to the petitioner till submission of the charge-sheet. Since no case has been filed against petitioner, the question of granting anticipatory bail to the petitioner till submission of the police report is a misconceived one and it is a vague proposition of law. It is pertinent to not that anticipatory bail may be granted even to a person against whom no first information report has been lodged subject to the condition that a reasonable belief/ground exists for imminence of a likely arrest for malicious and omnibus reasons. The anticipatory bail is neither a passport to the commission of crimes nor shield against any and all kinds of accusations, likely or unlikely. The anticipatory bail cannot be granted to a person/accused for the reason that he or she is in mere fear that he or she may be arrested and the same cannot be granted on vague apprehension of arrest. Mere fear is not a belief for which reason the accused/person may be granted anticipatory bail. Anyway, if we make the Rule absolute in this matter, the floodgate of the anticipatory bail will be open and everyone will come before the Court for anticipatory bail on fancy grounds. In our country, many proceedings of enquiry are going on for the alleged offences under sections 26 and 27 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 and other allegations/offences of corruption. But if we start granting anticipatory bail to all persons/ accused on the given facts and circumstances, then it will create chaos to the administration of justice and it will affect the whole criminal justice system of the country.

42. Furthermore, the Rule issuing bench had no jurisdiction to issue Rule and grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner since that court had no jurisdiction to hear and dispose of any matter of the Durnity Daman Commission.

43. It may be noted that the scope and guideline for granting anticipatory bail have been well defined, underlined and demarcated by the Appellate Division in many milestone judgments including the judgments cited and discussed above.

44. Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, the submissions advanced by the learned Advocates for the respective parties and the propositions of law cited and discussed above, we do not find any merit in this Rule and we are not inclined to allow the petitioner to remain on anticipatory bail making the Rule absolute.

45. Accordingly, the Rule is discharged.

46. In consequence thereof, the ad-interim order of anticipatory bail granted to the petitioner till submission of the police report if any is recalled and vacated.
Let a copy of this judgment and order be communicated to the Chairman, Anti-Corruption Commission at once.

Judgment
Md Akhtaruzzaman J: This Rule, arising out of an application under section 435/439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, has been issued calling upon the opposite parties to show cause as to why the impugned order dated 9-1-2018 passed by the learned Joint Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Manikganj in Sessions Case No.8 of 2016, arising out of CR Case No. 166(Satu)/2015, corresponding to Petition
Case No. 230(Satu)/2015, under section 312/313/34 of the Penal Code acquitting the accused-opposite party Nos. 2-4 from the case should not be set-aside and/or such other order or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.

2. Briefly, the facts leading to the issuance of the Rule are that one Md Al-Amin as complainant filed a petition of complaint being Petition Case No. 230(Satu)/2015 before the Court of Senior Judicial Magistrate, Court No.2, Manikganj against 3(three) accused, namely, 1) Shirin Akter, 2) Md Kader, and 3) Laily Begum under section 312/313/34 of the Penal Code alleging, inter alia, that he got married with accused No.1 and started conjugal life following which in the month of June, 2015 the latter became pregnant. But, on 25-8-2015, accused Nos. 2 and 3 brought accused No. 1 from the house of the complainant-petitioner on the provocation that she would be given in marriage elsewhere. Thereafter, accused Nos. 2/3 along with accused No. 1 went to a clinic at Manikgonj and were able to cause miscarriage of the child of accused No.l. Being informed, the complainant-petitioner asked the accused persons about the occurrence at which they admitted their involvement in the crime and also asked the former to do whatever he could do. Alleging all the facts, the complainant-petitioner filed a petition of

complainant before the Magistrate concerned who, upon receiving the same, directed the Officer-in Charge of Saturia Police Station, Manikgonj to hold an inquiry. Accordingly, SI Md Hasan Ali of that PS enquired about the matter who having found prima facie case against accused Nos. 1-3 submitted inquiry report on 19-9-2015 before the concerned Magistrate Court. Subsequently, the case was transferred to the Court of the learned Sessions Judge, Manikgonj wherein it was registered as Sessions Case No.08 of 2016. Thereafter, on 27-9-2016, the learned Sessions Judge, Manikgonj framed charge against the accused under section 312/313/34 of the Penal Code fixing 23-10-2016 for trial. The case record was then transferred to the Court of the learned Joint Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Manikgonj settling 9-1-2018 for trial on which date the prosecution sought adjournment of the case which was rejected by the Court acquitting all the accused under section 265H of the Code from the charge mounted against them vide its order No. 17 dated 9-1-2018.

3. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid order of acquittal dated 9-1-2015 passed by the learned Joint Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Manikgonj, the complainant-petitioner moved this Court under section 439 read with section 435 of the Code and obtained the instant Rule.

4. In the revisional application, the petitioner stated, among others, that without complying with the

provisions of section 265H of the Code, the Court below most illegally passed the impugned order occasioning failure of justice.

5. None appears on behalf of the complainant-petitioner to press the Rule though the matter is posted in the list with the name of the learned Advocate for the complainant-petitioner. However, we have heard Mr Bashir Ahmed, learned Deputy Attorney-General, appearing for the State-opposite party who finds it difficult to oppose the Rule.

6. Considered the submission advanced by the learned Deputy Attorney-General, perused the application filed under section 439 read with section 435 of the Code with grounds stated thereon along with the annexures attached thereto and also took into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case.

7. Annexure-A is the petition of complaint wherein it has been categorically disclosed that the complainant and accused No. 1 validly got married 1 (one) year before the date of occurrence by a registered Kabinnama. The marriage was duly consummated and as a result accused No.1 became pregnant in the first week of June, 2015. It is further stated that the accused Nos.2 and 3 with their ill intention tried to convince accused No.1 to get married elsewhere and accordingly on 25-8-2015 they took away accused No.1 from the house of the complainant. Thereafter, without informing or taking prior permission from the complainant, the accused Nos. 2 and 3 were able to illegally caused miscarriage of accused No.1 occasioning irreparable loss and injury to the complainant which is a punishable offence under section 312/313/34 of the Penal Code. It has further been stated that the petitioner subsequently came to know about the occurrence and asked accused No.1 regarding the incident to which accused No.1 admitted her guilt explaining that with the direct provocation as well as instigation of accused Nos.2 and 3 she did the same and further that he (complainant) can do whatever he could.

8. On going through the inquiry report (Annexure-B) submitted by SI Md Hasan Chowdhury of Manikgonj Police Station before the Senior Judicial Magistrate, Manikgonj it appears vividly that during the inquiry, he found prima facie case against the accused wherein it is stated, among others, that during the marriage between the complainant and accused No.1, accused No. 2 received Taka 1,15,000 as loan from the complainant. Both accused Nos.2 and 3 are greedy persons, as a result, they insisted accused No.1 to get married elsewhere and to that effect these 2(two) accused on the date and time of occurrence brought accused No.1 at Manikgonj Super Diagnostic Center to cause miscarriage of her pregnancy and subsequently were able to do the same and in course of investigation accused No. 1 admitted her guilt. During the inquiry, the inquiry officer examined as many as 6(six) witnesses including the accused and thereafter, found prima facie incriminating materials against the accused of committing offence under section 312/313/34 of the Penal Code.

9. After receiving the inquiry report, the concerned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and transmitted the case to the Court of Sessions Judge, Manikgonj for trial who by his Order No.8 dated 27- 9-2016 framed charge against the accused under the above sections of law and sent the same to the Joint Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Manikgonj for disposal. It further appears from the impugned Order No. 17 dated 9-1-2018 that on this particular date all the 3(three) accused were present but the prosecution filed an application seeking adjournment of the case for bringing witnesses but it was rejected by the learned Joint Sessions Judge and by exercising her power under section 2651-1 of the Code, the learned Joint Sessions Judge passed an order of acquittal of the accused with the observations that the Court on several occasions issued processes to the witnesses including the complainant but they did not turn up. The learned trial Court also observed that the complainant is not interested to examine himself before the Court. Thereafter, considering the principles enunciated in the case of Kamar Ali vs Abdul Marini, reported in 39 DLR 319, the Court below disposed of the case in the manner as stated above.

10. Now, the paramount question before us is whether in a sessions case the concerned Court has any power and/or authority to acquit an accused under section 265H of the Code without examining any witnesses or without exhausting the legal procedures for making sure of the attendance of the witnesses?

11. In a normal course of law, neither the Sessions Judge nor the Additional Sessions Judge or the Joint Sessions Judge has any power to acquit any accused without examining any witnesses or without exhausting the formalities laid down in the Code. However, to address the same, the relevant laws and rules are need to be addressed here to arrive at a correct decision on the matter mentioned above. Section 265H of the Code is reproduced below in verbatim: -

"If after taking the evidence for the prosecution, examining the accused and hearing the prosecution and the defense on the point, the Court considers that there is no evidence that the accused committed the offence, the Court shall record an order of acquittal."
12. From a plain reading of the provisions of section 265H it transpires vividly that after framing charge against the accused, the Sessions Judge is bound to examine witnesses and upon hearing the prosecution as well as defence if he considers that there is no evidence to proceed against the accused then the Court should pass an order of acquittal to acquit the accused. Recording the evidence before passing such an order is mandatory under section 265H of the Code.

13. In the case of State of Kerala vs Mundan reported in 1981 CriLJ 1795 it was held by Kerala High Court:

"8. After duly considering the arguments advanced on either side and carefully perusing all the relevant sections in Chapter XVII, we are of the view that the words "no evidence" in section 232 CrPC cannot be construed or interpreted to mean absence of sufficient evidence for conviction or absence of satisfactory or trustworthy, or conclusive evidence in support of the charge. The Judge has to see whether any evidence has been let in on behalf of the prosecution in support of their case that the accused committed the offence alleged, and whether that evidence is legal and relevant. It is not the quality or the quantity of the evidence that has to be considered at this stage. If there is any evidence to show that the accused has committed the offence, then the Judge has to pass on to the next stage. It is not open to him to evaluate or consider the reliability of the evidence at this stage.
9. Sections 225 appearing in Chapter XVIII of the Code, deal with procedures relating to trial of cases before the Court of Session. The object of section 232, no doubt, is to have a speedier conclusion of the trial and to avoid unnecessary harassment to the accused by calling upon him to enter on his defence and adduce evidence. This section substantially corresponds to sub sections (2) and (3) of section 289 of the previous Code and there is no material change. In a trial, before a Court of Session, an accused has a right to claim for a discharge under section 227 of the Code. This is a new provision introduced in the present Code. Under this section if upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in that behalf,

the Judge considers that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused after recording his reasons for so doing. Under section 228 which is also a new section, if, after consideration of the record and documents referred to in section 227 of the Code, and hearing both parties, the Judge is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which is exclusively triable by that court, he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused, and if the °Pence is not exclusively triable by that court, he may frame a charge against the accused and, by order, transfer the case for trial to the Chief Judicial Magistrate. Under the above sections, the Judge is not considering any evidence in the strict or legal sense, but it is only the recorded the case and the documents submitted therewith which have to be considered by him. It is not necessary that at this stage these documents must have been proved. Under section 232, what the Judge has to look into and consider is whether there is legal evidence adduced on behalf of the prosecution connecting the accused with the commission of the crime and not its quality and quantity. He is not to consider at this stage the sufficiency, reliability or trustworthiness of that evidence. In other words, what the Judge has to see is whether there is any evidence on record which, if true, would amount to legal proof of the offence charged against the accused and not whether that evidence is satisfactory, trustworthy or reliable. Although direct decisions under section 232 on the point are very few, there are a number of decisions under section 289 of the Previous Code, where various High Courts have considered what is meant by the expression "no evidence" in that section. It is a salutary principle in a sessions trial that no final opinion as to the reliability or acceptability of the evidence should be arrived at for the Judge until the whole evidence before him and has been duly considered. (See Queen Empress vs Ramalingam (ILR 1897 Mad 445). It is only after the accused is called upon to enter his defence under section 233 and after the evidence, if any, adduced on behalf of the accused and hearing the counsel appearing for both sides, the Judge hearing the case after a due consideration of the evidence decides whether the evidence adduced on behalf of the prosecution is reliable and trustworthy. In cases solely depending upon the ocular account of the witnesses, it might sometimes happen that all those witnesses, one by one, might turn hostile to the prosecution without giving any evidence in support of the prosecution. There may be a case where the only legal evidence on record in support of the prosecution case is the confession of a co-accused or the evidence of witnesses examined on behalf of an accused. In cases where there are a number of accused, it might happen there may not be any evidence connecting one or more of them with the commission of the offence. These may also be cases where evidence connecting the accused with the crime is only rank hearsay. All these are cases where it can be said that there is no evidence that the accused committed the offence and section 232 can be invoked. But in a case where there is some evidence connecting the accused with the commission of the crime, it is the duty of the Judge to pass on to section 233 and not to appreciate that evidence and find out whether it was reliable or not to pass an order under section 232 CrPC. The expression "there is no evidence" under section 289 does not mean absence of reliable or conclusive evidence but means absence of evidence which, if believed to be true, would warrant a conviction. (See Emperor vs Nawal Kishore 30 CriLJ 519 at p. 521 (Pat)). It was held in Rahamali Howladar vs Emperor AIR 1925 Cal 1555: 26 Cri LJ 1151 that if there is any evidence, although worthless. Judge should not direct jury to return verdict of not guilty; that no evidence worth the name is under the law very different from no evidence: that if a Judge directs the jury to return a verdict of not guilty, because he holds that there was no evidence worth the name against the accused, he commits an error of law. The question what is meant by "no evidence" under section 232 came up for consideration before the Karnataka High Court in Kumar vs State of Karnataka MANU/KA/0137/1975 and before the Bombay High Court in MANU/MH/0318/ 1977. In both these cases, it was held that under section 232 the Sessions Judge has to look into the prosecution evidence and the materials brought out in the examination of the accused and after hearing the counsel for both sides decide whether there is any evidence or not, to show that the accused had committed the offence and that at that stage the Judge is not entitled to evaluate the evidence and find out whether the evidence is reliable and trustworthy. In Pari Barn vs State of UP : (1970) 3 SCC 703 while considering a similar question arising under section 289 of the Previous Code, it was held by the Supreme Court that what section 289 requires is that if the Sessions
Judge comes to the conclusion that there is evidence to show that the accused had committed the offence, then the accused should be called upon to enter on his defence and that the value to be attached to that evidence was not to be considered at that stage. A Division Bench of this Court also, as pointed out earlier took the same view in State of Kerala vs Mohamedkutty 1977 Ker LN Case No. 34 p. 62. We
are in respectful agreement with this decision which, according to us, does not require any reconsideration. On looking into the materials on record in the light of the principles stated above, it cannot be said that this is a case where there is no evidence as contemplated under section 232 CrPC.

10. It is clear from the above discussion and finding that the learned Sessions Judge has committed a clear illegality by appreciating and finding out whether the evidence was reliable and trustworthy and acquitting the accused under section 232 CrPC. This being a serious illegality the order of acquittal under this section has to be set-aside and the case has to be sent back to the court below, for fresh disposal.


We therefore allow this appeal, set-aside the order of acquittal, without going into the merits or demerits of the evidence on record, send back the case to the trial court for disposal afresh according to law, from the stage where the illegality was committed by that Court."

14. In Queen Empress vs Vajiram [(1892) ILR 16 Born 414] it was held that the words "no evidence" in the 2nd and 3rd clauses of section 289 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Act X of 1882) must not be read as meaning "no satisfactory, trustworthy or conclusive evidence". If there is evidence, the trial must go on to its close, when in trials by jury, the jury, and in other trials, the judge after considering the opinion of the assessors have to find on the facts. It is only in the absence of any evidence as to the commission of the offence by the accused that the Court can record an acquittal without allowing the trial to go on, or obtaining the opinion of the assessors, or that the Court can direct the jury, without going into the defence, to return a verdict of not guilty.

15. It was thus in substance held that if there is evidence, the trial must go on to its close; the words "no evidence" must not be read as meaning "no satisfactory, trustworthy or conclusive evidence."

16. In respect of object of enacting section 232 of the Code (section 265H in our jurisdiction) in the case of Hanif Banomiya Shikalkar vs The State of Maharashtra reported 1981 CriLl 1622 Bombay High Court observed:

"27. In Queen Empress vs Imam Ali Khan, ILR (1396) Cal 252, it was ruled that the formality of calling upon an accused person to enter on his defence under the provisions of section 289 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 is not a mere formality, but is an essential Nut of a criminal trial. Omission to do so occasions a failure of justice, and is not cured by section 537 of the Code.
30. Now the object of section 232 of the Criminal Procedure Code (new) is to expedite the conclusion of the Sessions trial and, at the same time, to avoid unnecessary harassment to the accused by calling upon him to adduce evidence or to avoid the waste of public time when there is no evidence at all. The accused will have to be acquitted under section 232 of the Code if there is no evidence at all. If there is some evidence, no order of acquittal can be recorded. The court is not to embark upon the question at that stage whether the evidence is sufficient or is reliable. If, however, the Court finds that there is no evidence at all, the order of acquittal had to follow. Such an order would be subject to appeal. The learned Judge passing such an order may have to give some reasons as to why he came to the conclusion that there was no evidence at all as his order of acquittal would be ordinarily subject to appeal. However, if there is no acquittal, ordinarily a small order on the order sheet or somewhere in the proceedings indicating that that was not a case of 'no evidence at all' and that the accused has not been acquitted and that he is called upon to enter on his defence would be sufficient. An unnecessarily long order, as happened to be made in Arun's case MANU/MH/0318/1977 (supra) would cause an apprehension in the mind of the accused that the learned Judge has already made up his mind as to the guilt of the accused. It is clear from the wording of section 232 that the question whether the accused wants to lead evidence in defence would not arise when the trial is at the stage of section 232 of the Criminal Procedure Code. It would be necessary to put that question to the accused when the trial enters the stage of section 233."

17. In the case of Md Taheruddin vs Abul Kashem reported in 37 DLR 107 a Division Bench of this Court observed: -

"8. If prosecution witnesses are absent on the date fixed for the examination of witnesses, the Sessions Court has to see whether an adjournment is necessary or advisable. Section 344 CrPC enables the Sessions Court to postpone or adjourn the proceedings and it is worthwhile to quote section 344 CrPC in this regard: "344 (1) If, from the absence of a witness, or any other reasonable cause, it becomes necessary or advisable to postpone the commencement of, or adjourn any inquiry or trial, the Court may,
if it thinks fit, by order in writing, stating the reasons therefore, from time to time, postpone or adjourn the same on such term as it thinks fit, for such time as it considers reasonable, and may by a warrant remand the accused if in custody:
Provided that no Magistrate shall remand an accused person to custody under this section for a term exceeding fifteen days at a time."

Recent substantive changes in the Code of Criminal Procedure in Bangladesh have not made any difference in the legal position in so far as the trial of a case before a Sessions Court is concerned. After a charge is framed in a Sessions Court the complainant is turned into an informant. It is the State, which becomes the prosecutor and it no longer remains the duty of the informant to secure the attendance of his witnesses in the Court. It becomes the Court study and unless the Court exhausts all available modes of securing the attendance of witnesses, any order of acquittal for non-attendance of witnesses will clearly order, be an illegal order. Whatever the Sessions Court is required to do to ensure the presence of the informant and his witnesses by legal process, the Court must do and then proceed with the trial according to law. Law authorises the Sessions Court to pass an order of acquittal under section 265H, CrPC only after taking the evidence for the prosecution, examining the accused, hearing the prosecution and the defence and giving a finding that there is no evidence that the accused committed the offence. It postulates that the Sessions Court has to take all possible steps for taking the evidence for the prosecution. It cannot simply acquit the accused persons for default of the prosecution witnesses to attend the Court on the date of trial. The Public Prosecutor has no business to inform Court that the informant had lost interest in the prosecution of the case and the Sessions Court is also not obliged to honour that information without exhausting itself all the processes for compelling the attendance of prosecution witnesses. It is only when the Sessions Court exhausts all the processes then it acquires the right of recording an order of acquital in substantial compliance with the provisions of section 265H CrPC.
18. In the case of Amend Hogue vs Rajah reported in 38 DLR (AD) 303 it has further been observed by our Apex Court that: —

"Chapter 23 provided for trial before a Court of Session. Section 265A provides that in every trial before a Court of Sessions, the prosecution shall be conducted by a Public Prosecutor who opens the case on behalf of the prosecution.
Section 265C enables the Court to discharge the accused by recording the reasons for so doing if the Court considers "there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused." Even at this stage no evidence is produced. Then the Court frames charge if it is of opinion "that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence."

Section 265D(2) provides that the charge shall be read and explained to the accused and the accused shall be asked to plead. If the accused pleads guilty, the Court shall record the plea and may, in discretion, convict him thereon (Section 265E). If the accused, however, claims to be tried, the Court shall fix a date for the examination of witnesses and may, on the application of the prosecution issue any process for compelling the attendance of any witness or the production of any document or other thing. Then section 265G provides for recording of evidence.
Now comes section 265H which reads as under:
If after taking the evidence for the prosecution, examining the accused and hearing the prosecution and the defense on the point, the Court considers that there is no evidence that the accused committed the offence, the Court shall record an Order of acquittal."
19. It is only at this stage the Court can pass an Order of acquittal. Section 339C provides for time for disposal of cases for different categories of Courts. Sub-section (3) reads as under:

"If for any reason to be recorded in writing a Magistrate or a Sessions Judge, Additional Sessions Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge is unable to conclude the trial of a case within the specified time, he shall conclude such trial within thirty days after the expiry of the specified time."
Sub-section (4) reads as under
"If a trial cannot be concluded within the specified time or the extended time as mentioned in sub-section (3) further proceedings in respect of the trial shall stand stopped and the accused person released."
20. Reading these two sections together there is no hesitation in saying that the learned Sessions Judge erred in law in passing the order of acquittal. The High Court Division further fell into error when dealing with the contention of the learned Advocate for the prosecution that the learned Sessions Judge ought to have exhausted all process including issuing warrant of arrest to secure attendance of the witnesses and the learned Judges observed that "it does not appear the prosecution made any such prayer nor it seems to be aggrieved by the Order of acquittal". The observation is unfortunate because section 265F provides "the Court may on the application of prosecution, issue process for compelling the attendance of any witness." In a criminal trial the State is the prosecutor and it was the duty of the State to secure the attendance of the witnesses and if for any reason it needed the process of the Court the same should be issued on the application of the prosecution. Without complying with this provision the learned Sessions Judge passed the order of acquittal which is not sanctioned by Law and therefore, this Order must be set aside."

21. It is also observed by another Bench of this Court that when all process to compel attendance of prosecution witness is completed, order of acquittal under section 265H is correct. Explaining the scope of section 2651-1 of the Code the Court states that:-

"In the instant case, summons were issued on 14-3-84 and thereafter, warrants were issued on 22-4-84 for compelling the attendance of the prosecution witnesses. In the circumstances, we are of the opinion that the observation made by the learned Additional Sessions Judge that sufficient opportunity was given to the prosecution and all processes were exhausted for compelling the attendance of the prosecution witnesses appears to be correct. In the circumstances of the case, after the failure of the prosecution to adduce any evidence, we are of the opinion that the learned Additional Sessions Judge was competent to pass the impugned order of acquittal under section 265H. Apart from this, for our satisfaction, whether there has been a miscarriage of justice, we have gone through the (original) First Information Report, statements made by the 6 charge-sheeted witnesses under section 161 (certified copy) and the postmortem report (certified copy). The allegations made in the First Information Report disclose that an offence under section 364 of the Penal Code had been committed at 02-00 hours on 2-7-81. The FIR was lodged at 9-00 hours on 6-7-81. There is a delay of more than 4 days in lodging the FIR. It has also been
stated in the FIR that one Aftar Ali who came to rescue victim Chand Ali, was severely beaten and he was admitted in the Sunamgonj Hospital for treatment. Aftar Ali is not a charge-sheeted witness. The place of occurrence is only 20 miles away from Sunamgonj police station. Taking all these facts into consideration and the attending circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served in setting aside the impugned order of acquittal. We are further of the opinion that there has been no miscarriage of justice caused by the impugned order of acquittal. [Kamar Ali vs Abdul Manaf 39 DLR 319]
22. Criminal Rules and Orders (Practice and Procedure of Subordinate Court), 2009 was issued by the authority of the Supreme Court (High Court Division) where in Rule 638 the procedures that to be followed by the Court concerned under section 265H of the Code is reproduced as under: -

"Rule 638. (1) Before passing an order of acquittal under section 247 of the Code, the Magistrate should ascertain that summons was issued at the time of taking cognizance on complaint. If warrant of arrest is issued on complaint, or if it is a police case, section 247 of the Code has no application at all. Attention is also drawn to the fact that on the date fixed for hearing of such complaint case, if the complainant does not appear and the Magistrate does not adjourn the hearing of the case, an order of acquittal shall be passed under section 247 of the Code. The date on which appearance of the complainant is not necessary, the Magistrate should not generally apply this provision in passing an order of acquittal in an unreasonable manner.
Proviso to section 247 of the Code should be kept in view while passing orders thereunder.
(2) An order stopping a proceeding and releasing the accused at any stage without pronouncing judgment under section 249 of the Code should be passed in a police case only. This power should be used sparingly and it cannot be invoked in a complaint case. When the Magistrate is fully satisfied that the prosecution witnesses are not available on so many consecutive dates even after his best endeavour by exhausting all processes of the Court issued and served properly in time and there exists exceptional and unusual circumstances preventing the court from proceeding with the case, this power can be exercised. Once the Magistrate has stopped the proceeding and released the accused, there is no scope for revival of the case by him as decided in the case of Niamat Ali Sk vs Begum Enayetur Noor reported in 42 DLR
(AD) 250. So the Magistrates are to be very careful in exercising the power under section 249 of the Code.
(3) For the Sessions Judges, when all processes to compel attendance of the prosecution witnesses are exhausted and prosecution witnesses have failed to appear, an order of acquittal may be recorded under section 265H of the Code to get rid of unnecessary dragging of the sessions cases for years together.
The principles enunciated in the case of Kamar Ali vs Abdul Manaf reported in 39 DLR 320 and in the case of Md Taheruddin vs Abdul Kashem reported in 37 DLR 107 may be followed in dealing with sessions cases in this regard."
23. So, from the above discussion, it is clear that before passing an order of acquittal, the Sessions Court must take necessary measures to secure attendance of the witnesses and in appropriate cases, the same should also be issued at the instance of the Public Prosecutor and further that in a criminal trial the State is the Prosecutor and in the present case at our hand, the Public Prosecutor filed an application seeking adjournment of the case on the ground of bringing witness to prove the case. But, as we have observed, the learned Joint Sessions Judge, without showing any valid reasons has rejected the said petition. Before exhausting all available modes of securing the attendance of witnesses, passing order of acquittal by the Sessions Judge is nothing but a clear violation of law which tentamounts to miscarriage of justice. In this situation, our considered view is that in exercising his power under section 265H of the Code, the Sessions Judges, at first, shall take meaningful steps for securing the attendance of the witnesses; and secondly: if any witness is available record the same; and thirdly: in case of non-availability of any other witnesses, take hearings from both the parties and thereafter shall pass an order of acquittal of the accused.

24. Now, let us see the impugned order dated 9-1-2018 passed by the learned Joint Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Manikganj which reads as under:

“অদ সা রী জন দিন ধায আছে অ মামলার জামিনমু ৩ জন আসামী (১) শিরিন আ ার (২) কাদের (৩) লাইলী বগম হাজির আছেন রা!প সা রী জন সময়ের আবেদন করিয়াছেন

অতএব,

আসামী শিরনী আ ার, মাঃ কাদের ও লাইলী বগমকে The Code of Criminal Procedure এর 265(H) ধারা অনযুায়ী খালাস *দান করা হলো
25. From the above it appears that the learned Joint Sessions Judge without going through the relevant provisions of section 26511 of the Code as well as the relevant Rules [Rule No. 638] of the Criminal Rules and Orders, [Volume I] has illegally passed the impugned order occasioning failure of justice.

26. Under the provisions of section 26511 of the Code the duty of a Sessions Judge is to look into the prosecution evidence and materials brought out in the examination of the accused and thereafter should hear the learned Advocates of both sides and considering the evidences and materials on record if he finds that all the procedures under the law have been exhausted and if he is of the opinion that he has taken all possible steps for taking down the evidences of the prosecution but the prosecution has miserably failed to comply with the order of the Court, in that case, the duty casts on the Court to pass an order of acquittal of the accused. But in the present case, it appears manifestly that the learned Joint Sessions Judge without complying with the relevant laws and procedures has illegally dismissed the petition filed by the prosecution with the observations that the prosecution is not willing to adduce, evidences.

27. Having gone through the entire materials on record, our compassionate view is that the learned Joint Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Manikganj has illegally passed the order of acquittal of the accused on 9-11- 2018 which is not in accordance with law and, as such, is liable to be set-aside.

28. In the result, the Rule is made absolute.

29. The impugned order dated 9-1-2018 passed by the learned Joint Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Manikganj in Session Case No.8 of 2016 is set-aside.

30. The learned Joint Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Manikgonj is directed to dispose of the case afresh according to law, as early as possible.

Communicate the judgment and order to the Court concerned forthwith.

End.
