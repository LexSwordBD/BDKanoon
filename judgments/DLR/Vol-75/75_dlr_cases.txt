JUDGMENT
Md. Ashfaqul Islam, J.

1. All the review petitions are directed against a judgment of this court in its appellate forum maintaining the death sentence awarded to the petitioners Md. Zahangir Alam, Dr. Mian Mohammad Mohiuddin and commutation of sentence from death to imprisonment for life awarded to Md. Abdus Salam.

2. The prosecution case, in short, was that, Dr. S. Taher Ahmed was the senior most Professor of the Department of Geology and Mining, University of Rajshahi. He was a Member of both the Departmental Planning Committee and the Expert Committee of the University. Pursuant to the pre-concerted plan, Dr. Taher was brutally killed at his Quarters (Pa-23/B) by all the accused in furtherance of their common intention 1-2-2006 after 10-00 pm or thereabout on his arrival thereat from Dhaka. After the killing of Dr. Taher, his dead body was dumped into a manhole behind the place of occurrence house. In the morning of 3-2-2006, his dead body was recovered from the manhole. Thereafter, the son of the victim, namely, Mr. Sanjid Alvi Ahmed alias Himel (PW 1), lodged an ejahar with Motihar Police Station, Rajshahi.

3. The Investigating Officers PW 47 Md. Omar Faruk, PW 48 Md. Golam Mahfiz and PW 49 Achanul Kabir investigated the case. Accused Zahangir Alam, Abdus Salam and Nazmul made confessional statements before PW 46 Magistrate Jobeda Khatun recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Finding prima facie case, the last Investigating Officer submitted a charge-sheet against all the accused including the acquitted accused Md. Azim Uddin Munshi and Md. Mahbub Alam @ Saleheen for committing offence punishable under section 302/201/34 of the Penal Code.

4. The Tribunal charged all the accused except Azim Uddin Munshi under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and the co-accused Azim Uddin Munshi was charged under section 201 of the Penal Code. They pleaded not guilty thereto and claimed to be tried.

5. The defence version of the case, as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, was that the accused are innocent and have been falsely implicated in the case and the alleged confessional statements of the accused Zahangir, Salam and Nazmul are the products of police torture, oppression and maltreatment and the PW 25 Dr. Md. Sultan-ul-Islam Tipu and PW 29 Golam Sabbir Sattar Tapu are responsible for the death of Dr. Taher.

6. After hearing both the parties and upon perusing the materials on record and having regard to the attending facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the prosecution brought the charge home against the appellants and petitioners, and accordingly, it convicted and sentenced them. The Tribunal also found the co-accused Saleheen and Azim Uddin Munshi not guilty and accordingly acquitted them.

7. Against the said judgment and order of the Tribunal, the convicts preferred criminal appeals and jail appeals. The Tribunal transmitted the record to the High Court Division for confirmation of the sentence of death which was registered as Death Reference No. 57 of 2008. The High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order, dismissed the Criminal Appeal Nos. 3455 and 4058 and Jail Appeal Nos. 631-634 of 2008. However, the High Court Division commuted the sentence of death to imprisonment for life awarded to convict Md. Abdus Salam and Md. Nazmul. It confirmed the sentence of death awarded to the appellant Dr. Mian Md. Mohiuddin and Md. Zahangir Alam. Against which, they preferred criminal appeals, criminal petitions and jail petitions and the state preferred Criminal Petitions. By a judgment and order dated 5-4-2022 this Division dismissed all those cases and affirmed the death sentence awarded to the petitioners Md. Zahangir Alam, Dr. Mian Mohammad Mohiuddin and commutation of sentence from death to imprisonment for life awarded to Md. Abdus Salam. Against which the present review petitions have been filed by the convicts.

8. In the judgment the charges and evidence of the witnesses both oral and documentary have been meticulously considered and after evaluation of the same this court affirmed the sentence of death awarded to the two petitioners and commutation of sentence from death to imprisonment for life awarded to the another petitioner as mentioned above. In a review matter this court cannot re-assess the evidence afresh and re-hear the case. This court disposes of the points so far as it is relevant for the disposal of the matter. Learned Counsel argued on various points as if he were arguing an appeal and accordingly we refrained from discussing those points on reassessment of the evidence.

9. Mr. SN Goswami, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioners in Review petition Nos. 66 and 69 of 2022 has submitted a written argument. His contention is that this court committed error of law in believing the confessional statements made by the accused petitioners without considering the following points:

Confessional statement of accused Jahangir was not voluntary in nature.
Confession recorded by Magistrate in violation of section 164(3), Code of the Criminal Procedure cannot be used to convict the Appellant
Confessional statement of accused Jahangir was not true.
Retracted confession should be corroborated in material particular by other evidence.
10. The points raised by the learned counsel as above have already been answered by this Division in the appeal. This court has thoroughly assessed the evidence of the witnesses both oral and documentary and on a careful evaluation of the confessional statements, found that their statements are consistent with one another and corroborates the version given by each other and opined that confessing accused were speaking the truth. Therefore, those points are beyond the ambit of review and there is no scope for reconsideration of those facts.

11. The learned Senior Advocate further submits that the accused petitioner is in the condemn cell for more than 14 1/2 years suffering the pangs of death and it may be a good ground for commutation of sentence of death.

12. Mr. SM Shahjahan, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner in Review petition No. 67 of 2022 has adopted the same argument advanced by the learned Senior Advocate Mr. SN Goswami.

13. On the other hand Mr. AM Aminuddin, the learned Attorney-General appearing for the State, submits that this Division elaborately discussed the evidence and answered those points raised by the learned Senior Counsel in the judgment sought to be reviewed. Since the points have already been considered by this Division in the judgment and the learned Counsel failed to show any error of law apparent on the face of the record in the conclusion arrived at by this Division, the points raised by the learned Counsel do not call for any interference.

14. Let us first discuss the relevant law, rules and decisions of the apex courts of home and abroad to maintain a petition for review in a criminal proceeding.

15. Provision of Article 105 of the Constitution empowers this Division to review its judgment pronounced or Order made "subject to the provisions of any Act of Parliament or of any Rules made by the division". This Division has made Rules for the review of criminal proceeding.

16. Rule 1 of Order XXVI in part IV of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh (Appellate Division) Rules, 1988 provides:-
"Subject to the law and the practice of the Court, the Court may, either of its own motion or on the application of a party to a proceeding, review its judgment or order in a Civil proceeding on grounds similar to those mentioned in Order XLVII, rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in a Criminal Proceeding on the ground of an error apparent on the face of the record."

17. In the case of Zobaida Naher @ Jharna vs. Khairunnessa being dead her heirs Md. Feroz Alam and others 3 BLC (AD) 170 it has been observed:
"A review cannot be granted to urge fresh grounds when the judgment itself does not reveal an error apparent on the face of the record. To allow such a prayer for review is to allow re-hearing of the appeal on points not urged by a parry".

18. For better understanding let us now discuss what is an error apparent on the face of the record. This has been explained in the case of AHM Mustain Billah vs. Bangladesh 57 DLR (AD) 41. The concept of error apparent on the face of the record has been explained by his lordship Md. Fazlul Karim, J. at paragraphs 27-28:
"Mere error of fact or law is no error on the face of the record. It is such obvious error of law, which has either crept through Court's oversight or Counsel's mistake and failure to explain the legal position by the learned Counsel for the party. The error must be such which at a glance can be detected without advancing elaborate argument.
Though there is no hard and fast rule as to what is an error apparent on the face of the record but the same depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. But there could not be an error apparent on the face of the record merely because two possible views as to the interpretation or application of law vis-a-vis the particular facts of a case, one view accepted by the Court though may be erroneous but could not be the ground of review even if a decision or order is erroneous in law or on merits, the same shall not amount to an error apparent on the face of the record."

19. In the case of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto vs. Suite reported in PLD 1979 SC 741 as to scope of review and what is error apparent it has been observed:
"In Order that an error may be a ground for review, it is necessary that it must be one which is apparent on the face of the record, that is, it must be so manifest, so clear that no Court could permit such an error to remain on the record. It may be an error of fact or of Law, but it must be an error which is self-evident and floating on the surface, and does not require any elaborate discussion or process of ratiocination. The contention mat the exposition of the Law is incorrect or erroneous, or mat the Court has gone wrong in the application of the Law to the facts of the particular case: or that erroneous inferences have been drawn as a result of appraisal or appreciation of evidence, does not constitute a valid ground for review. However, an Order based on an erroneous assumption of material fact, or without adverting to a provision of Law, or a departure from an undisputed construction of the Law and the Constitution may amount to an error apparent on the face of the record. At the same time if the judgment under review or a finding contained therein, although suffering from an erroneous assumption of facts, is sustainable on other grounds available on the record then although the error may be apparent on the face of the record, it would not justify a review of the judgment or the finding in question. In other words, the error must not only be apparent, but must also have a material bearing on the fate of the case. Errors of inconsequential import do not call for review."

20. In a good number of cases of this Division including the case of Mazdar Hossain vs. Ministry of Finance 7 BLC (AD) 92 it has been held:
"A review is no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected. A review lies where an error apparent on the face of the record exists. It is not a rehearing of the main appeal. Review is not intended to empower the Court to correct the mistaken view of law, if any, taken in the main judgment. It is only a clerical mistake or mistake apparent on the face of the record that can be corrected by leave but does not include the correction of any erroneous view of law taken by the Court."

21. In the case of Sow Chandra Kanta and another vs. Sheik Habib reported in MANU/SC/0064/1975 : AIR 1975 SC 1500 where Krishna Iyer, J. observed as follows:
"A review of a judgment is a serious step and reluctant resort to it is proper only where a glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility. A mere repetition through different counsel of old and overruled arguments, a second trip over ineffectually covered ground or minor mistakes of inconsequential import are obviously insufficient. The very strict need for compliance with these footers is the rationale behind the insistence of counsel's certificate which should not be a routine affair or a habitual step."

22. A review cannot be granted to urge fresh grounds when the judgment itself does not reveal an error apparent on the face of the record. To allow such a prayer for review is to allow a rehearing of the appeal on points not urged by a party. We find support for this view from the following observation of Hamoodur Rahman, CJ in Mohd. Hussain vs. Ahmad Khan, 1971 SCMR 296 (297):
"A review cannot be granted on the ground that the Counsel appearing at the original hearing did not argue or press a particular point which was available to him then and could have been found out with a little amount of diligence. This would really amount to granting a re-hearing of a matter merely to make good the failure on the part of Counsel to argue all the points that could have been argued. This cannot furnish an adequate ground for review."

23. The core question for consideration is whether there is error apparent on the face of the record which calls for interference of the impugned judgment. It is an established jurisprudence that a review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected, but lies only against patent error of law. Where without any elaborate argument one could point to the error and say that here is a substantial point of law which stares one in the face, and mere could reasonably be no two opinions to be entertained about it, a clear case of error apparent on the face of the record would be made out. It is only a clerical mistake or mistake apparent on the face of the record that can be corrected but does not include the correction of any erroneous view of law taken by the Court.

24. Further, it has now been settled that an error is necessary to be a ground for review but it must be one which is so obvious that keeping it on the record will be legally wrong. The moot point is, a party to a litigation is not entitled to seek a review of judgment merely for the purpose of rehearing or a fresh decision of the case. The power can be extended in a case where something obvious has been overlooked-some important aspects of the matter has not been considered, the court can reconsider the matter. There are exceptional cases where the court can remedy its judgment. In the alternative, it may be said that the error must also have a material real ground on the face of the case.

25. This Division has repeatedly held that the court should not be oblivious of the theme that when the finality is attached to the judgment delivered by a court, particularly the judgments at the apex level of the judicial hierarchy, upon a full-fledged hearing of the parties, a review petition being neither in the nature of a rehearing of the whole case nor being an appeal against judgment, review is not permissible only to embark upon a reiteration of the same contention which were advanced at the time of hearing of the appeal, but were considered and repelled in the judgment under review. It was also expressed that while dispensing justice, it is the duty of the court to resolve the issue of law properly brought before it and once it is done, the finality is reached and then a review cannot be made on any grounds whatsoever. It is because of the fact that an opinion pronounced by this Division which stands at the apex of the judicial hierarchy should be given finality and any departure from that opinion will be justified only when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character make it necessary to do so.

26. Thus, the powers of review can be exercised sparingly within the limits of the statute. In the realm of law the courts and even the statues lean strongly in favour of finality of decisions legally and properly made. If the cases are reopened on flimsy grounds which have already been addressed by the courts then mere will be no end to the litigation. That is why, the power of review is restricted by given guidelines of the apex courts of the sub-continent.

27. Another vital aspect in respect of sentence of death for the offence of murder has been spelt out in the case of Rasedul Islam vs. State 68 DLR (AD) 114 which is as under:--
"Predictably the exceptions to section 300 of the Penal Code have no application in this case and the accused persons have also not taken any plea in this regard. When such an act which is eminently dangerous and must in all probability cause death is committed with knowledge mat death might be the probable result without any excuse,' the offence is murder. This clause applies only to a case of dangerous actions without intention to cause specific bodily injury to any person. The knowledge which accompanies the acts must be death. The act was so eminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death. The sentence provided for the offence of murder is death and only in extraneous circumstances, life sentence may be awarded. On consideration of the brutality of the incident, the High Court Division has rightly confirmed the sentence of death to the petitioners. No special reason is required to be assigned in awarding the death sentence if the offence attracts section 302. Since the sentence of death is the legal sentence for murder particularly if the murder is perpetrated cold-bloodedly and in the absence of any extenuating circumstances to commute the sentence, this Division has committed 'no error of law in maintaining' the petitioners' sentence. The accused petitioners were involved in heinous crime which was committed with inhuman brutality and the very nature of the incident called for no other than the extreme penalty provided in law. The enormity of the crimes and the gravity of the situation in which it was committed outweigh the consideration of other factors to consider the commutation of the sentence. As regards delay, it is now settled that mere delay is not a legal ground for commutation of the sentence."

28. But in the instant case, the learned Counsel for the petitioners argued the case, as if treating the case one as a regular appeal without attempting to make out a case one of error in the decision apparent on the face of the record or that the judgment is liable to be reviewed for any substantial reasons or any statutory provision was unnoticed in the impugned judgment.

29. From the nature of the offence it appears to us that the petitioner is in no way entitled to get any sympathy. We do not find any mitigating or extenuating circumstances on record for commutation of the sentence of death. Delay in the disposal of this case cannot by itself be a ground for commuting the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life since the crime committed by the petitioner was premeditated senseless, dastardly and beyond all human reasonings.

30. On the question of confessional statements, this court has discussed the evidence thoroughly in support of the plea and disbelieved the defence plea. All points agitated by the learned counsels on behalf of the petitioners are not relevant for disposal of the review petition. The points raised by the learned counsels are reiteration of the points agitated at the time of hearing of the appeal.

31. In a recent decision of Md. Shukur Ali vs. the State 74 DLR (AD) 11 of this Division his lordship Mr. Obaidul Hassan, J. observed:
"We hold that confessional statement of a co-accused can be used against others non-confessing accused if there is corroboration of that statement by other direct or circumstantial evidence. In the instant case, the makers of the confessional statements vividly have stated the role played by other co-accused in the rape incident and murder of the deceased which is also supported/corroborated by the inquest report, postmortem report and by the depositions of the witnesses particularly the deposition of P.Ws. 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 18 regarding the marks of injury on the body of the deceased. Every case should be considered in the facts and circumstances of that particular case. In light of the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are of the view that the confessional statement of a co-accused can be used for the purpose of crime control against other accused persons even if there is a little bit of corroboration of that confessional statement by any sort of evidence either direct or circumstantial. (Emphasis added). Thus, the accused namely Shukur and Sentu are equally liable like Azanur and Mamun for murdering the deceased after committing rape."

32. Further in the instant case his Lordship Mr. Hasan Foez Siddique, CJ maintained:
"There was no provocation and the manner in which the crime was committed was brutal. It is the legal obligation of the Court to award a punishment that is just and fair by administering justice tempered with such mercy not only as the criminal may justly deserve but also the right of the victim of the crime to have the assailant appropriately punished is protected. It also needs to meet the society's reasonable expectation from court for appropriate deterrent punishment conforming to the gravity of offence and consistent with the public abhorrence for the heinous offence committed by the convicts. It is unfortunate but a hard fact that appellants and petitioners have committed such a heinous and inhumane offence. The murder of a genius professor of the University has shocked the collective conscience of the Bangladeshi people. It has a magnitude of unprecedented enormity."

33. Culture of impunity and magnanimity in no way can over shadow the fathomless detestable offence that has been committed in this ill-fated ugly case. Mercy cannot be an option in such type of case.

34. We insist on accountability for gruesome violations of our penal law because that is how we defend the law and demonstrate our insistence on respect for the law going forward in a progressive legal system. If we tail to ensure accountability across the legal system by ending impunity, we risk undermining the very beneficial effects to which the nascent accountability drive that has built over the past decades. That is the final message we would wish to propel in adjudicating this significant criminal review espousing incidents that were horrendous and vile.

35. Fortified with the decisions and discussions as made above we are of the view that there is hardly any scope of rehearing of the matter afresh as a court of appeal in a review petition Further in the instant petition the learned counsel fails to point out any error in the judgment apparent on the face of the record. Therefore, all the review petitions merit no consideration and accordingly those are dismissed.

Judgment
M. Enayetur Rahim, J: This review application under Article 105 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is directed against the order dated 24-11-2016 passed by this Division in civil petition for leave to appeal No. 971 of 2014 disposing the same with observations.

2. Facts, relevant for disposal of the review petition are as follows:

The present Respondent No. 1 (herein-after referred to as writ petitioner-respondent) filed writ petition No. 7314 of 2011 under article 102 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh before the High Court Division challenging the proceedings contain in Memo No. দুদক/সেকজা/ঢাকা-১/২৬০৫ dated 7-8-2011 issued by the writ respondent No. 3 directing the writ petitioner-respondent to submit records in connection of his wealth statement.

3. In the writ petition it is contended that the writ respondent No: 3 as an inquiry officer issued a notice being Memo No. দুদক/সেকজা/ঢাকা-১/১৭৪৬ dated 19-10-2010 to the writ petitioner-respondent asking for submitting some records of wealth of the writ petitioner-respondent and to make appearance before him on 26-10-2010 at 10-00 am.

4.In response to the said notice/memo dated 19-10-2010 the writ petitioner-respondent submitted the written wealth statement before the writ respondent No. 3 on 7-11-2010 and accordingly the writ respondent No. 3 accepted the said written statement of wealth.

5.Thereafter, the writ respondent No. 2 issued a notice being Memo No. দুদক/সেকজা/ঢাকা-১/৬৫১ dated 24-4-2011 to the writ petitioner-respondent by exercising power under section 26(1) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 asking him to submit his wealth statement.

6.Thereafter, the writ petitioner-respondent prayed time for submitting the statements of wealth on 23-5-2011 and 25-5-2011 respectively and the writ respondent No. 2 allowed 7 (seven) days time for submitting the same by his memo dated 31-5-2011.

7. Thereafter, the writ petitioner-respondent on 31-5-2011 submitted wealth statement before the writ respondent No. 2 along with his family members statements of wealth on prescribed form.

8. Eventually, the writ respondent No. 3 as an inquiry officer issued a notice being Memo No. দুদক/সেকজা/ঢাকা-১/২৬০৫ dated 7-8-2011 to the writ petitioner-respondent asking him to submit some records of wealth and to make appearance before him on 16-8-2011 at 10-00 am.

9. Having received the above notice the writ petitioner-respondent challenged the same before the High Court Division by filing the above writ petition.

10. A Division Bench of the High Court Division initially issued a Rule Nisi and after hearing the Rule by its judgment and order dated 13-6-2013 discharged the Rule relying on the case of Md Shahidullah Mia vs Government of Bangladesh and others in connection with writ petition No. 940 of 2011.

11. Against the said judgment and order the writ petitioner-respondent filed civil petition for leave to appeal No. 971 of 2014 before this Division and this Division after hearing disposed of the same with the observations as under:

"The matter relates to issuance of notice upon the writ petition for submitting wealth statement. We noticed from the record that 3 (three) successive notices have been served upon the writ petitioner, of them, 2 notices were issued by the same officer of the Commission. If the Commission is not satisfied with the wealth statement, there is provision for filling case against the writ petitioner, but the Commission cannot issue repeated notice upon any person for submitting wealth statement. This is a malafide act on the part of Durnity Daman Commission. We direct the Chairman of Durnity Daman Commission to take legal action against the officers who intentionally issue such notices. The judgment of the High Court Division is quashed."
12. Feeling aggrieved by the above findings and observations, the writ respondent-Durnity Daman Commission (hereinafter referred. to as the Commission) has filed this review petition.

13. Mr Md Khurshid Alam Khan, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the present petitioner submits that the issuance of notice for gathering information regarding the wealth statements is necessary for conducting the inquiry/investigation and, as such, issuance of successive notices do not mean harassment; hence, question of malafide act on the part of the Commission does not arise at all.

14. Mr Khan further submits that the impugned notice has been issued in view of section 19/20 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Ain, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as Ain, 2004) read with rule 20 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Rules, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as Rules, 2007) and section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. There is no legal bar to issue successive notices for collecting information regarding the allegations made in the complaint and it is not possible for the Commission to ascertain whether the wealth is disproportionate to know source of the writ petitioner-respondent's income or not. and, as such, question of malafide act of the issuance of successive notices by the Commission does not arise at all and, as such, the impugned order is required to be reviewed.

15. However, Mr SM Shahjahan, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the writ petitioner-respondent having supported the impugned order passed by this Division has submitted that in guise of inquiry or investigation, as the case may be a citizen cannot be harassed by the investigating agency i.e., the Commission.

16. We have heard the learned Advocates for the respective parties, perused the impugned order and notice as well as the relevant provision of law and Rules.

17. In the instant case the petitioner Commission served a notice on 7-8-2011 upon the writ petitioner-respondent, which was as under:

18. Though High Court Division held that the Commission has got the power to issue such a notice but this Division by the impugned order did not endorse the said view, rather disposed of the same holding that if the Commission is not satisfied with the wealth statement there is provision of filing case against the writ petitioner, but the Commission cannot issue repeated notices upon any person for submitting wealth statement. This is a malafide act on the part of the Commission.

19. This Division further directed the Chairman of the Commission to take legal action against the officers who intentionally issued such notices and also quashed the judgment of the High Court Division.

20. To decide the issue involved in the case it is necessary to examine rule-8 & 11 of the Rules, 2007 which run as follows:

“৮। অনুসন্ধান কার্য চলাকালে অভিযুক্ত ব্যক্তির শুনানী গ্রহণ-
(১) দুর্নীতি বিষয়ক কোন অভিযোগের অনুসন্ধান চলাকালে কমিশন বা কমিশন কর্তৃক ক্ষমতা প্রাপ্ত কোন কমিশনার বা কর্মকর্তা যদি মনে করে যে, অভিযোগের সহিত সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যক্তির বক্তব্য শ্রবণ করা প্রয়োজন তাহা হইলে অভিযুক্ত ব্যক্তিকে লিখিত নোটিশ প্রদান করিয়া নোটিশে উল্লিখিত সময়সীমার মধ্যে মৌখিক বা লিখিত বক্তব্য পেশ করিবার সুযোগ প্রদান করিতে পারিবে।
(২) উপ-বিধি (১) এর অধীন নোটিশ প্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তি তাহার বিরুদ্ধে আনীত অভিযোগ খণ্ডন করিয়া নোটিশে নির্দেশিত সময়সীমার মধ্যে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে বা তাহার নিয়োজিত আইনজীবীসহ মৌখিক বা লিখিত বক্তব্য পেশ করিতে পারিবে এবং উক্তরূপে বক্তব্য পেশ করা হইলে সংশ্লিষ্ট কমিশনার বা কর্মকর্তা উহা সংশ্লিষ্ট নথিতে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করিবেন।”
...
“১১। তদন্ত কার্য চলাকালে অভিযুক্ত ব্যক্তির শুনানী গ্রহণ-
(১) দুর্নীতি বিষয়ক কোন অভিযোগের অনুসন্ধান শেষ হওয়ার পর অভিযোগ প্রাথমিকভাবে প্রতিষ্ঠিত হইলে তদন্ত চলাকালে কমিশন যদি মনে করে যে, অভিযোগের সহিত সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যক্তির বক্তব্য লিখিত নোটিশ প্রদান করিয়া নোটিশে উল্লিখিত সময়সীমার মধ্যে মৌখিক বা লিখিত বক্তব্য পেশ করিবার সুযোগ প্রদান করিতে পারিবে।
(২) উপ-বিধি (১) এর অধীন নোটিশ প্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তি তাহার বিরুদ্ধে আনীত অভিযোগ খণ্ডন করিয়া নোটিশে নির্দেশিত সময়সীমার মধ্যে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে বা তাহার নিয়োজিত আইনজীবীসহ মৌখিক বা লিখিত বক্তব্য পেশ করিতে পারিবে এবং উক্তরূপে বক্তব্য পেশ করা হইলে সংশ্লিষ্ট কমিশনার বা কর্মকর্তা উহা সংশ্লিষ্ট নথিতে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করিবেন।”
21. From the above rules it is abundantly clear that in course of inquiry or investigation, as the case may be, the Commission has got the power to issue notice upon the person(s) against whom an inquiry or investigation is going on to appear before the Commission for giving him a chance to hear and to place or submit his written or verbal statement and connecting documents with regard to the allegation brought against him.

22. The provision of section 26 of the Ain, 2004 is as follows:

"Declaration of assets.—
(1) Whenever the Commission, on any information and after conducting such [inquiry] as it may deem necessary, is satisfied that any person or any other person on his behalf is in possession or has acquired any property disproportionate to his legal source of income, the Commission may, by order in writing, direct that person to furnish statement of his assets and liabilities including any other information specified in that order in the manner prescribed by the Commission.
(2) If any person—
(a) fails to submit a written statement or an information in compliance with the order mentioned under sub-section (1) after receipt of the same or submits any written statement or any information which for sufficient reasons is considered false or baseless, or
(b) submits any book, accounts, record, declaration, return or any document under sub-section (1) or gives any statement which, for sufficient reasons, is considered false or baseless,
he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 (three) years, or with fine, or with both."
23. If, we meticulously examine the above provision, then it will be crystal clear that prior giving notice under section 26 of the Ain, 2004 the commission has got the power to make an inquiry. Further, the Commission, if after receiving the statement furnished by the concerned person(s) pursuant to the notice under section 26 of the Ain, 2004 is not satisfied, then as per rule 6 of the Rules, 2007 the Commission for the purpose of holding inquiry is empowered to appoint an inquiry officer, and in course of inquiry the Commission or concerned officer as authorized to do so is also empowered to issue notice as per provision of rule 8 of the Rules, 2007 upon the concerned person(s) for the purpose of inquiry asking him to submit or place his written or verbal submissions and the relevant documents.

24. Thus, notice under section 26 of the Ain, 2004 and notice for the purpose of inquiry in view of rule 8 of the Rules, 2007 is quite different and distinguishable.

25. Upon perusal of the notice, impugned before the High Court Division, Annexure-F to the writ petition it reveals that in the notice subject matter of the notice (বিষয়) has been described as ‘বিষয়: অনুসন্ধানের স্বার্থে তথ্যাদি সরবরাহ প্রসঙ্গে’ And in the said notice the writ petitioner-respondent was asked to provide the documents in support of his wealth statement submitted pursuant to the notice under section 26 of the Ain, 2004.

26. So, it is clear that the notice has been issued upon the writ petitioner-respondent for the purpose of proper and effective inquiry and the writ petitioner-respondent was asked to submit/provide the documents in support of his wealth statement submitted before the commission in pursuant to the notice under section 26 of the Act, 2004.

27. We have no hesitation to hold that this procedure of inquiry by the Commission is very fair, transparent and accountable and this procedure is for the benefit of the person(s) against whom an inquiry is going on. In course of inquiry the concerned person(s) is getting chance of being heard before the inquiry officer to defend himself. Similarly, after filling of the case during investigation period Rule 11 of the Rules, 2007 provides similar provision for defending an accused in an investigation process.

28. Further, section 19 of the Act, 2004 has empowered the Commission to do anything prescribed for carrying out of purpose of the Ain, 2004.

29. Section 19 of the Ain, 2004 runs as follows:

"19. Special Powers of the Commission in respect of inquiry or investigation.—
(1) The Commission shall have the following powers in respect of inquiry and investigation, namely:—
(a) to issue [notice to witnesses] and ensure attendance thereof and to examine witnesses;
(b) to detect and produce any document;
(c) to take evidence;
(d) to call for public records or copy thereof from any court or office;
(e) to issue [notice] for examination of witnesses and documents; and
(f) to do anything prescribed for carrying out the purposes of this Act.
(2) The Commission may require any person to furnish any information regarding a matter of inquiry or investigation and the person so required shall be bound to furnish such information kept under his custody.
(3) if any person causes resistance to any officer legally empowered by the Commission or a Commissioner in exercise of his powers under sub-section (1), or deliberately disobeys any direction given under that sub-section, it shall be a punishable offence and for such offence he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 (three) years, or with fine, or with both."
30. It is our considered view that the word `any person' used in section 19(2) includes the person(s) against whom inquiry or investigation as the case may he is going on.

31. Similar provision, like section 19 of the Ain, 2004 has also been made in rule 20 of the Rules, 2007 empowering the inquiry/investigating officer to take following measures—

ক্রমিক নং	কমিশনের বিশেষ ক্ষমতা	ক্ষমতা প্রাপ্ত কর্মকর্তা
১ (ক)	সাক্ষীর প্রতি নোটিশ জারি ও উপস্থিতি নিশ্চিতকরণ এবং জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করা	অনুসন্ধান কার্যের দায়িত্ব প্রাপ্ত কর্মকর্তা, বা তদন্ত কার্যের দায়িত্ব প্রাপ্ত কর্মকর্তা, যে ক্ষেত্রে যাহা প্রযোজ্য
২ (খ)	কোন দলিল উদঘাটন এবং উপস্থাপন করা
৩ (গ)	কোন অফিস হইতে পাবলিক রেকর্ড বা উহার অনুলিপি তলব করা
৪ (ঘ)	আইনের উদ্দেশ্য পূরণকল্পে নির্ধারিত অন্য যে কোন বিষয়
32. If we meticulously examine the above two provisions i.e., section 19 of the Act, 2004 and 20 of Rules; 2007, coupled with rule 8 and 11 of the above Rules, then we have no hesitation to hold that those provisions have been made for the interest and benefit of a person(s) against whom an inquiry or investigation is going on as he is giving opportunity to defend himself in inquiry or investigation stage. Thus, there is no room to say that issuance of such notice by the Commission or its authorized officer is harassing, malafide and prejudiced to the concerned person(s).

33. Earlier, in disposing the leave petition this Division did not take into consideration the above provisions of law and Rules and thus, came to a erroneous decision, which is apparent on the face of the record.

34. Thus, impugned order is reviewed. Findings and observations made in the order are hereby expunged. The order of quashment of the proceedings and directing the Commission to take legal action against the officers who issued the notices are set-aside.

Accordingly, the review petition is disposed of.

End.

Result:
Appeal Dismissed

JUDGMENT
Jahangir Hossain, J.

1. Both the appeals have arisen out of the common judgment and decree of the High Court Division. This Division has also heard both the appeals analogously and disposed of the same by a single judgment.

2. These two civil appeals, by leave, are directed against the judgment and decree dated the 1st day of December, 2011 passed by the High Court Division in First Appeal Nos. 183 and 184 of 2008 allowing the appeals.

3. The relevant facts for disposal of these civil appeals, in short, are that plaintiff-respondent, Dr. Md Abdul Malek filed Title Suit No. 39 of 2004 and plaintiff-respondent, Begum Parvin filed Title Suit No. 40 of 2004 both in the Court of Joint District Judge, 3rd Court, Dhaka, alleging, inter alia, that they had joined Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research [BCSIR] on 27-12-1980 as Research Officer and on 13-11-1981 as Research Zoologist and the authority with satisfaction got them promoted as Senior Scientific Officers on 24-8-1990 and on 30-3-1988. They had been serving there for 23[twenty three] years and 22[twenty two] years respectively without violating any rules and regulations of BCSIR. Both the plaintiff-respondents applied to visit Canada from 1-2-2002 to 30-4-2002 at their own costs and they were accordingly granted permission by the authority to visit Canada. After going there, they became sick because of adverse cold weather prevailing in Canada. While sick, they had applied from Canada for extension of leave for further one year and the defendant-appellants had received their applications in due time. They sent the applications through registered mail. The pro-forma defendant Nos. 4 and 5 made assurance to the plaintiff-respondents for granting extension of leave by a fax message on 28-9-2003. Thereafter, on 19-11-2003, they came back to Dhaka in order to perform the ritual following the death of the mother of plaintiff-respondent, Dr. Md Abdul Malek and then went to the office of BCSIR and came to know that they were dismissed from their respective service on 23-9-2003 by a letter under reference Further case of the plaintiff-respondents is that no show cause notice was issued upon them by the defendant-appellants and in spite of knowing the fact that the respondents were staying in Canada, the defendant-appellants deliberately abstained from sending any letter or show cause notice to their address in Canada and had fabricated many documents with the intention to dismiss them from their respective service. They got no opportunity to defend their case and, as such, the order of dismissal is absolutely against the principle of natural justice and they have been dismissed under that law which is not applicable to their case. Hence, they filed the suits with prayer that the letter described in the schedule to the plaint to be declared illegal and also to declare that the respondents are still in the service of the appellants from 30-4-2002 and to pay them necessary costs and to grant any other reliefs as they are entitled to as per law and equity.

4. The defendant-appellants by filing written statement denying all the material allegations, contending, inter alia, that the suits are not maintainable in the present form. There were no causes of action for filing the suits. The suits are barred by limitation as well as by the principles of waiver and acquiescence. The main contention of the appellants is that in the letter dated 12-1-2002 by which the respondents were granted leave, there was a condition that under no circumstances the leave should be extended. The appellants further contend that they sent letters to the respondents in Canada and asked them to join their respective service and they had also issued notices and second show cause notice in the newspapers as per applicable rules, but in spite of expiry of the period of leave, the respondents were illegally staying in Canada and, as such, the order of dismissal was lawful and the respondents cannot get any relief in the suits.

5. During the trial in Title Suit No. 39 of 2004, the plaintiff-respondent examined him-self as PW 1 and produced some documents in support of his case which were marked as exhibit Nos. 1 to 9. The appellants examined one Md Shamsul Haque, Administrative Officer of BCSIR, as DW 1 to support their case and produced certain documents which were marked as exhibit Nos. Ka to Jha. While in Title Suit No. 40 of 2004, the plaintiff-respondent examined herself as PW 1 and produced some relevant papers in support of her case, which were marked as Exhibit Nos. 1 to 20. The appellants examined the aforesaid Administrative Officer, BCSIR, as DW 1 to support their case and produced certain documents which were marked as exhibit Nos. Ka to Jha.

6. The trial Court, after having heard the parties and assessed the evidence on record, dismissed the suits by its judgments and decrees dated 24-4-2008. Feeling aggrieved by the judgments and decrees of the trial Court, the present-respondents as appellants preferred First Appeal Nos. 183 of 2008 and 184 of 2008 before the High Court Division. The learned Judges of the High Court Division having heard the appeals analogously allowed them.

7. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree of the High Court Division, the defendant-appellants preferred the aforesaid civil appeals arisen out of Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos. 1187-88 of 2012 before this Division.

8. Mr. Sheikh Reajul Hoque, learned Advocate, appearing for the appellants, submits that plaintiff-respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have filed the suits for declaration that the order of dismissal from service is illegal and they are still in service but have not prayed for any direction for their reinstatement and thereby the suits are not maintainable. He further adds that the learned Judges of the High Court Division failed to appreciate that the plaintiff-respondents joined the BCSIR before enforcement of and the authority of BCSIR rightly dismissed plaintiff-respondent Nos. 1 and 2 after following all legal formalities as provided in the law.

9. On the contrary, Mr. Murad Reza, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 2, contends that without issuing any show cause notice, the appellants, BCSIR, most illegally dismissed them from service in violation of the principle of natural justice by depriving them from getting any opportunity to defend themselves against the allegations brought in. He further contends that the authority of BCSIR was fully aware of the address of the plaintiff-respondents in Canada, but they hopelessly failed to bring any evidence before the Court below to show that they issued the notices asking the plaintiff-respondents to join their respective services. He also contends that the impugned letter dated 29-3-2003 [Exhibit 8] was issued under section 3(b) of the Government Servants (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1979 and the plaintiff-respondents were dismissed under 4(A) of the said Ordinance. The plaintiff-respondents were not Government Servants, rather employees of BCSIR, their dismissal from respective services under the provisions of Government Servants (Special Provision) Ordinance, 1979 is void ab-initio. He finally contends that while the plaintiff-respondents fell ill in Canada, they sent applications on 18-2-2002 to the defendant-appellants praying for extension of leave from 1-4-2002 to 30-4-2003 and the defendant-appellants, the then Chairman of BCSIR having received the same vide a fax message dated 28-9-2003 assured the plaintiff-respondents that their prayers for leave would be granted but the same was not subsequently considered by the authority and, as such, the instant appeals are liable to be dismissed.

10. Heard the contentions of the learned Advocates for both the parties and perused the materials along with other connected papers on record.

11. It reveals from the relevant documents on record that the plaintiff-respondents are husband and wife. Both of them were appointed in BCSIR on different dates. They went to Canada taking 3 [three] months' ex-Bangladesh leave from 1-2-2002 to 30-4-2002 to visit their relatives. In the approval letters of leave of the plaintiff-respondents, there were some conditions to the effect that under no circumstances, the leave should be extended. Admittedly, both the plaintiff-respondents after going there fell ill because of adverse cold weather in Canada and during their illness, they applied to defendant-appellants No. 2 to extend their leave from 1-5-2002 to 30-4-2003, i.e. for l[one] year. Thereafter, they applied for 2[two] years' medical leave from 1-5-2003 to 30-4-2005. In total, they prayed for 3[three] years' leave. Defendant-appellants No. 2 assured them to grant the prayers for leave. The trial Court opined that the plaintiff-respondents should have returned home making their leave short because of adverse cold weather in Canada. Here, the trial Court failed to realize the reason of their not coming back to Bangladesh and to resume their work in the office. They submitted medical report which was not satisfactory to the trial Court. It appears that the plaintiff-respondents participated in a project extended for 3 [three] months and consumed 3[three] months' leave in Canada involved themselves in different personal activities. They reiterated that they had been ill. It is also revealed from the findings of the trial Court that the defendant-appellants sent letters dated 29-7-2002 asking them to return home and join the service within 15[fifteen] days, otherwise, their service will be terminated as per Government Servants [Special Provisions] Ordinance, 1979. They sent two show cause notices first on 28-11-2002 and second on 8-1-2003. The show cause notices were also published in the daily newspapers. But the plaintiff-respondents as alleged did not respond to the notices. Thereafter, in the 154th Board Meeting of the Council held on 28-7-2003, the Board took decision to dismiss the plaintiff-respondents from their respective services. Therefore, the Council dismissed them from respective services on 23-9-2003. In overall observation of the trial Court, it is revealed that the plaintiff-respondents showed negligence in joining their respective services and disobedience to the letters of the defendant-appellants. Moreover, they did not show cogent grounds for extending their leave. They only prayed that they were ill for adverse cold weather. The trial Court further observed that as there was no cold weather in Bangladesh, they would have returned in Bangladesh shortening their leave and then they would come round. It is also observed that they first took ex-Bangladesh leave for visiting their relatives only.

12. It reveals that Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Ordinance, 1978 has been established under section 3(1) of the Ordinance as a statutory public body. According to the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 3, the Council shall be a body corporate. The Council is an entity distinct from the Government. It has been enshrined in section-3 of the Ordinance, 1978 that:

"3.(1) As soon as may be after the commencement of this Ordinance, the Government shall, by notification in the official Gazette, establish a Council to be called the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, (2) The Council shall be a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal with power, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, to acquire, hold and dispose of property, both movable and immovable, and shall be said name sue [sic] and be sued."
13. In section 18 of the Ordinance, 1978, the Council has been authorized to appoint its own officers and employees. It has been envisaged in section-18 that:

"The Council may, subject to such regulations as may be made in this behalf and the availability of budgetary provisions, create such posts and appoint, on such terms and conditions as it may determine such officers, consultants, advisers, auditors and other employees as it considers necessary for the efficient performance of its functions under this Ordinance:

Provided that no post carrying a monthly initial pay of Taka sixteen hundred or above shall be created without the approval of the Government."
14. The provisions of section 28 of the Ordinance, 1978 delegates to the Council powers, with previous approval of the Government to make regulations in order to provide for all matters for which provisions are necessary or expedient to give effect to the provisions of the Ordinance. BCSIR has accordingly framed a service Regulations, in 1989 for its employees which was published in Bangladesh Gazette dated Monday, January 9, 1989. It has been enunciated in section 28 that:

"(1) The Council may, with the previous approval of the Government, make regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance and the rules, to provide for all matters for which provision is necessary or expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Ordinance.

(2) All regulations made under this section shall be published in the official Gazette and shall come into force on such publication."
15. In Chapter two, regulation No. 3 deals with the procedure of appointments; in Chapter four, regulation No. 16 deals with the procedure of various kinds of leave, regulation No. 29 deals with the procedure of returning from leave; in Chapter seven, regulation No. 37 deals with ordinary conduct and discipline, regulation No. 39 deals with the procedure of various sorts of penalties, regulation No. 42 deals with the procedure of inquiry of severe penalty, regulation No. 45 deals with the procedure of re-instatement, regulation No. 47 deals with the procedure of appeal against any order.

16. Having examined the impugned letters both dated 29-3-2003 marked as Exhibit 8, by which the plaintiff-respondents were dismissed, that these letters were issued under section 3(b) of Government Servants (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1979 and they were dismissed under section 4(A) of the said Ordinance. It is apparent that the plaintiff-respondents were dismissed from their respective service by following the procedure and in exercise of the powers with reference to the Government Servants (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1979. It appears that BCSIR is a statutory public body and is an entity different from government. As per provisions of section 18 of the above mentioned Ordinance, the Council shall appoint its own officers and employees. It is clear that these two plaintiff-respondents were employees of BCSIR and they were not government servants. Being distinct entity, BCSIR has adopted a regulation on 8-1-1989 with previous approval of the government and in exercise of the power delegated under section 28 of the above Ordinance, being Chapter-7, containing regulation Nos. 37 to 48, makes provisions regarding conduct and discipline of the employees of BCSIR. It is observed that at the time when the notices were published in the newspapers, the regulations, prescribing specific provisions regarding disciplinary action, were very much in force and were also applicable in respect of the plaintiff-respondents. Although the plaintiff-respondents were not government servants, rather admittedly, they were servants/employees of BCSIR. It is found that the disciplinary proceedings initiated with reference to the Government Servants (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1979 along with issuance of the charge-sheets under section 3 of the said Ordinance and issuance of the letters of dismissal rendered with reference to section 4 of the said Ordinance are void ab-initio. But without resorting to the provisions of these regulations, the BCSIR authority has resorted to the procedure laid down in Government Servants (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1979.

17. On perusal of the record, it is revealed that the relief prayed in the suit does not come within the scope of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877. The plaintiff-respondents did not ask for any direction in the form of mandatory injunction seeking re-instatement. Admittedly, plaintiff-respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have not prayed for their re-instatement in service with arrear rather the relief sought for being in declaratory form and the trial Court found that such relief is not available to the plaintiff-respondents even though they have a good case for directing reinstatement. In the contentions of the learned Advocate for the defendant-appellants, it appears that the result of the instant suit is a decree without any consequential relief, i.e. without reinstatement in the service and arrear though the consequential relief is a mandatory provision of law and since the principle of mandatory injunction settled by this Division in the case of Rupali Bank Ltd. vs Md Arab Ali and others, reported in 7 BLC (AD) 1 and Jahir Uddin (Md) vs Rupali Bank Ltd. and others reported in 12 BLC (AD) 114, and Bangladesh Tobacco Company Limited and another vs Md Azizul Huq and another, reported in 8 MLR (AD) 149 : 7 BLC (AD) 119. In the case of Osman Gani Mondal vs Mainuddin Ahmed and others, reported in 27 DLR (AD) 61 wherein this Division held that it is a cardinal rule of construction that where statutory restrictions are couched in negative terms, they are almost invariably held to be mandatory and in another decision of the case of Aminul Islam and others vs M/s. James Finlay and Company Limited, Khulna, reported in 26 DLR (SC) 33, this Court held that it is needless to say that difficulties are sometimes felt to determine whether a certain provision of statute is directory or mandatory, when the legislature itself expresses its opinion as to. the consequence of non-compliance with a certain direction, no difficulty arises and from the book namely 'Interpretation of Statutes and Documents' written by Mr. Mahmudul Islam [Page-238; Mandatory and directory provision] wherein it is stated, "where a statute requires something to be done or to be done in a particular manner and the consequences of failure to do so are also provided, no difficulty arises and the provision is construed as mandatory" and from above decision, it has been settled that the proviso of section 42 of Specific Relief Act is a mandatory provision by following the provision of section 55 of the Specific Relief Act.

18. It has been enshrined in section 42 of the Specific Relief Act that:

"Any person entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such character or right, and the Court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further relief:

Bar to such declaration-Provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of tide, omits to do so.
19. It has been enumerated in section 55 of the Specific Relief Act that:

"When, to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel the performance of certain acts which the Court is capable of enforcing, the Court may, in its discretion, grant an injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of the requisite acts."
20. It is earlier discussed that BCSIR is a statutory body and it has its own individuality and separate entity which is to run following its own rules and regulations. It is found that the plaintiff-respondents had been dismissed from their services after taking decision of the Board of BCSIR upon recording the reasons thereon, but the proceeding drawn upon them and the notices published in the newspaper with the provisions of Government Servants (Special Provisions), Ordinance, 1979 is not concurrent with the rules and regulations of BCSIR.

21. The learned Advocate for the defendant-appellants in support of his contentions placed some references including the case of Osman Gani Mondal vs Mainuddin Ahmed and others, reported in 27 DLR (AD) 61, where it was held that:

"Thus the above contentions revolve round the question whether the second proviso to paragraph 7 of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution is mandatory or directory. It could not be disputed that, in general, the provisions in a Constitution should be regarded as mandatory where such construction is possible; Seen in this connection, the observation of Wynes in his "Legislative, Executive and Judicial Powers in Australia," Fourth Edition, page 28. This observation, with which we are in complete agreement is based on Colley pp 154-155, Black's "Interpretation." pp. 21-22 Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd Edn Vol. 31, pp-529 and following, and also a number of reported decisions. Seen also Sutherland's "Statutory Construction", 3rd Ed, Vol. 3, section 5807 which says that as a general proposition there is greater likelihood that constitutional provisions will be given mandatory effect, and that 'such a construction accords with the generally acknowledged import of constitutional fiat; that its character is such as to require absolute compliance in all cases without exception." It has been further explained that concepts of constitutional supremacy furnish reasonable grounds for "a presumption that the framers of a Constitution intended that just such efficacy be given to it."

Besides, the second proviso to the seventh paragraph of the Fourth Schedule has been cast in a negative or prohibitory form. It is a cardinal rule of construction that where statutory restrictions are couched in negative terms, they are almost invariably held to be mandatory: Sutherland, 3rd edition, Volume 3, p. 96, section 5814 which notes that "there is but one way to obey the command 'thou shall not,' and that is to refrain altogether from doing the forbidden act." This principle has been stated in Crawford's "Statutory Construction", page 516, section 261 in the following words:

"It is a rule of statutory construction that where a statute is framed in terms of command, and there is no indication from the nature of wording of the act or the surrounding circumstances that it is to receive a permissive interpretation, it will be construed as peremptory;" and again in section 263 at page 523 thereof it has been said: "Prohibitive or negative words can rarely, if ever, be directory, or, as it has been aptly stated, there is but one way to obey the command thou shall not', and that is to completely refrain from doing the forbidden Act. And this is so, even though the statute provides no penalty for disobedience. Accordingly, negative, prohibitory and exclusive words or terms are indicative of the legislative intent that the statute is to be mandatory,..."
22. In the case of Aminul Islam vs James Finlay and Company Limited, reported in 26 DLR (SC) 33 wherein it was held that:

"The moot question is whether the advice of the members of the Court is mandatory in making the award. Needless to say that difficulties are sometimes felt to determine whether a certain provision of statute is directory or mandatory. When the legislature itself expresses its opinion as to the consequence of non-compliance with a certain direction, no difficulty arises but in a case where the legislature does not indicate its mind as to the consequence of violation of such direction, the Court is to consider whether the direction is merely directory or mandatory and this is to be determined on the construction of the provision in question and the importance attached to the direction therein. As noticed earlier, rule 34 provides that the Chairman while giving an award shall consider the advice given to him the rule does not require the Chairman to follow the members to obtain their advice in any manner it is possible. It will be sufficient for the Chairman if he seeks the advice of the members. If any member intentionally refuses to give advice the Chairman has got no authority to impose any penalty upon him for his non-compliance with the rule. The question of consideration of the advice by the Chairman arises only when the advice is given. The rule is silent as regard the consequence of non-compliance. This clearly indicates that no special importance is attached to the direction as regards advice."
23. In the case of Jahir Uddin vs Rupali Bank Ltd. and others, reported in 12 BLC (AD) 115, it was held that:

"As it appears the High Court Division made the Rule absolute holding that admittedly, on and from 6-4-1984 the defendant bank, being denationalized, was converted into a private bank incorporated under the Companies Act, 1994 and, as such, the relationship between the plaintiff-petitioner and the defendant bank became that of master and servant from that date and therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to get a decree for declaration without consequential relief; in the instant case there is no prayer for mandatory injunction for consequential relief; even if there is a prayer for mandatory injunction but that too cannot be granted in view of legal bar under clause (e) of section 56 of the Specific Relief Act which provides that an order of mandatory injunction cannot be granted to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which could not be specifically enforced; the breach of contract for personal service cannot be restrained by court ordering an employer to retain the employee in the service as it is the prerogative right of the employer to discharge his employee and the Court cannot compel a person against his will to employ any person and the employer bank is liable for damage and compensation in terms of Service Rules and Regulations; the suit is not maintainable as the plaintiff challenged the order of suspension and the final show cause notice but did not challenge the order of dismissal in which the impugned order of suspension and show cause merged and with the order of dismissal[sic] the orders of suspension and final show cause became infructuous and in the instant case this issue, which cuts the case at its root, has not been considered at all by the appellate Court below."
24. From the submission of the learned Counsel for the plaintiff-respondents, it is found that BCSIR was established under section 3(1) of the Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Ordinance, 1978 as statutory public body. BCSIR has framed a Service Regulations in 1989 which is known as Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Employees Service Regulations, 1989. Under regulation 1(2), it will be applied for its permanent employees. Regulation No. 55 of the above mentioned Regulation refers that "By Laws" regulating the service of the plaintiff-respondents was repealed by the said Regulation. It is found that the plaintiff-respondents joined as Research Officer on 27-12-1980 and as Research Zoologist on 13-11-1981. According to regulation 1(2) of the above said Regulations, the provisions of the Regulations are applicable for the plaintiff-respondents. Previously, the employees of the BCSIR were guided by "By Laws", which has been repealed by regulation No. 55 of the said Regulation, enacted in 1989. They are the employees of BCSIR. Regulation Nos. 37 to 48 of the Service Regulations, 1989 laid down the provisions regarding conduct and discipline of the employees of BCSIR but without following the same, the notices were published and charge-sheets were issued under section 3 of the Government Servants (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1979. Hence, the said notices or charge-sheets are not valid in the eye of law. It is further appeared that the plaintiff-respondents were dismissed under section 4(A) of the Government Servants (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1979 from their respective service by following the procedure and in exercise of the powers with reference to the said Ordinance, which is applicable for the government servants. The above mentioned Regulation of BCSIR has not been included to the schedule of the Administrative Tribunal Act and, as such, there is no bar to file the suits in the civil court.

25. The contentions of the learned Advocate on behalf of the plaintiff-respondents in the case of Bangladesh Water Development Board, represented by its Chairman vs Syed Moazzem Hossain and others, reported in 1995 BLD (AD) 239 : 1 BLC (AD) 13, in which it was held that:

"A Declaratory suit need not be confined within the terms of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act which is meant for obtaining a specific relief. A declaration can be sought for various other matters as well."
26. It is found from close reading of the aforesaid decision reported in 1995 BLD (AD) 239 : 1 BLC (AD) 13 and 7 BLT(AD) 361 that the suit for simple declaration is maintainable in respect of service matter without any prayer for consequential relief. It has been held therein that a declaratory suit need not be confined in the terms of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.

27. In the case of Jiban Bima Corporation, Dhaka vs Mustafa Hussain and another, reported in : 50 DLR 411, it was held that:

"A declaratory decree passed in a case without any prayer for consequential relief is an "annuity". Such decree is a gain and its implementation is dependent on as to whom the decree is passed against. In the instant case, the defendant being a statutory Corporation, there is no reason to believe that such corporation will not implement the decision of the court"
28. Section 2(AA) of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 defines statutory public authority in respect of which Administrative Tribunal Act will be applicable. Section 2(AA) of the Act reads as follows:

"statutory public authority" means an authority, corporation, or body specific in the schedule to this Act."
29. The main contentions of the learned Advocate for the plaintiff-respondents are that the respondents are not government servants, they are employees of a statutory body, BCSIR and, as such, the dismissal is illegal in the eye of law as contrary to the service regulations. Therefore, the High Court Division rightly allowed the appeals observing that the impugned letters of dismissal are void ab-initio because the plaintiff-respondents were not government servants, they are the permanent employees of BCSIR. They should have been notified by and proceedings should have been drawn according to the said Probidhimala. Admittedly, it is seen from section 1 of the Regulation titled.

30. Under the circumstances, it appears that the plaintiff-respondents are the permanent employees of BCSIR and in their case, the provisions of the above Regulations shall operate. The defendant-appellants without resorting the existing regulations of the BCSIR, they resorted to the Government Servants Ordinance, 1979.

31. The plaintiff-respondents claimed that before dismissal from their respective service, they were not served any show cause notices, though the defendant-appellants claimed that they served show cause notices and the notices were also duly published in the daily newspapers but the plaintiff-respondents refused any kind of service of notices. It appears from the record that the first show cause notice under section 3(B) of the Government Servants (Special Provisions), Ordinance, 1979 dated 28-11-2002 was served giving 5[five] days' time and the second show cause notice under section 5(2) of the Government Servants (Special Provisions), Ordinance, 1979 dated 21-1-2003 was served giving 3[three] days' time. As the plaintiff-respondents are the permanent employees of BCSIR, the procedure of serving notice shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations and otherwise, the procedures are left to be followed illegally. Apart from this, Dw-1, in cross-examination, admitted that he had no knowledge whether the notices were served upon the plaintiff-respondents or not. It is revealed that the inquiry was held without having any knowledge of the plaintiff-respondents and the dismissal from service without affording opportunity of defence is illegal and arbitrary being violative of the principle of natural justice. It is also revealed that all the procedures of servicing notices, inquiry and dismissal had taken place under the Government Servants (Special Provisions), Ordinance, 1979 but it is obvious that the plaintiff-respondents are the employees of Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. It is our considered view that the defendant-appellants adopted wrong forum to dismiss the plaintiff-respondents from their services.

32. On consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case discussed above, we are of the view that the High Court Division is justified in allowing the appeals

Accordingly, both the appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs. However, for the period, the plaintiff-respondents were out of service shall be treated as leave without pay.

JUDGMENT
Md. Ashfaqul Islam, J.

1. This civil appeal by leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 18-7-2017 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 776 of 2016 making the Rule absolute and rejecting the plaint of Other Suit No. 450 of 2014 (hereinafter referred to as the present suit), after setting aside order No. 11 dated 13-3-2016 passed by the Joint District Judge of the 1st Court, Chattogram in the said Suit.

2. The present appellant Sree Suvash Chandra Dhar, as plaintiff on 1-12-2014 instituted Other Suit No. 450 of 2014 in the 1st Court- of Joint District Judge, Chattogram against the present respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and 11 others for (a) Determination of title, (b) Right to use pond under joint possession with other co-sharers, (c) Decree passed in Other Suit No. 41 of 1992 does not bar in possession of the suit land by the plaintiff and (d) the defendants are not entitled to take any action against the plaintiff in Execution Case No. 1 of 2014, contending, inter-alia that, 0.2150 acre of land described in the schedule to the plaint, including part of pond and homestead, belonged to two brothers named Kashi Mohon and Ananta Mohan, which was recorded in their names in RS Khatian. The said two brothers were members of Hindu Joint Family. Kashi Mohon died leaving behind Porikkhit Banik (Proforma defendant No. 3 in the suit) as his heir. Later on Ananta Mohon died child less leaving the said Porikkhit Banik. By peaceful possession on the suit land for a very long time Porikhhit Banik acquired a better title by adverse possession as well; that, PS and BS Khatian were correctly prepared in his name. Porikkhit Banik sold the suit land to the plaintiff Suvas Chandra Dhar by registered Kobala deed No. 1655 dated 24-8-1997. Since purchase the plaintiff is in possession of the suit land.

3. On 27-6-2014 the defendants No. 1 and 2 disclosed that they got decree in a suit for specific performance of contract, which has been affirmed by higher Court and asked the plaintiff to vacate the suit land else they will evict him through execution case.

4. To prevent them the plaintiff on 3-7-2014 filed case No. 1234 of 2014 under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The plaintiff has come to know that the defendants No. 1 and 2 obtained decree in suit for specific performance of oral contract for sale of land and it transpires that the said decree was obtained by practicing fraud on Court. The plaintiff came to know about the fraudulent decree of the defendants 1 and 2 on 15-11-2014 and hence he filed the suit.

5. On 25-1-2015, the defendants No. 1 and 2 appeared by filing written statement and thereafter fired an application praying for rejection of the plaint of Other Suit No. 450 of 2014 contending, inter alia, that the suit property originally belonged to Mohendra Lal Dey who died leaving behind three sons namely, Kali Shankar Dey, Hari Shankar Dey and Narayan Chandra Dey as his heirs to inherit the property left behind by their father, Mohendra Lal Dey. Kali Shankar Dey and his two brothers on 7-12-1989 being in need of money, entered into an agreement for sale of the said property with Sudhir Chandra Banik (father of the defendants No. 1 and 2) but subsequently, when Kali Shankar Dey and his brothers having refused to execute the kabala, Sudhir Chandra Banik father of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 instituted Other Suit No. 45 of 1990 against recorded tenants of the holding, which on successive transfer was lastly renumbered as Other Suit No. 41 of 1992 and was decreed. The said decree was reversed in other Appeal No. 521 of 1992 but the decree was restored in Civil Revision No. 4756 of 1995 and affirmed by the Appellate Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 81 of 2011. The decree has been put into execution in Other Execution Case No. 1 of 2014.

6. Porikkhit Banik predecessor in interest of the defendants No. 10 to 12 had instituted Other Suit No. 98 of 1992 for determination of title and confirmation of possession, which on transfer was re-numbered as Other Suit No. 91 of 1995 and was decreed. Sudhir Chandra Banik father of the defendants No. 1 and 2 preferred Other Appeal No. 153 of 1996, which was allowed and the decree was reversed. Porikkhit Banik preferred Civil Revision No. 4903 of 1999 against the said appellate decree but anticipating defeat later on he withdrew the said Civil Revision No. 4903 of 1999. The plaintiff of Other Suit No. 450 of 2014, Sree Suvash Chandra Dhar deposed as DW 2 in Other Suit No. 41 of 1992 but now he has instituted the suit suppressing all the past events.

7. The plaintiff contested the said application by filing written objection. By order No. 11 dated 13-3-2016 the trial Court was pleased to reject the application for rejection of plaint finding inter alia that the question of res judicata argued as a ground for rejection of plaint is a mixed question of fact and law, which can be decided only at trial on evidence.

8. The defendant Nos. 1 and 2 preferred Civil Revision No. 776 of 2016 before the High Court Division impugning the order No. 11 dated 13-3-2016 rejecting the application for rejection of plaint. Upon hearing the parties on contest, by the judgment and order dated 18-7-2017, the rule was made absolute and the plaint was rejected holding that, the plaintiff claims the suit land by purchase from Porikkhit Banik by Registered Kobala deed No. 1655 dated 24-8-1997. Porikkhit had instituted Other Suit No. 98 of 1992 in the 5th Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Chattogram for declaration of title, confirmation of possession and perpetual injunction and got decree, but on appeal in Other Appeal No. 153 of 1996 the decree was reversed against which Porikkhit Banik filed Civil Revision No. 4903 of 1999 in the High Court Division but later on he withdrew the Civil Revision on 11-5-2010 without any permission to sue afresh and as such the suit stands precluded under Order XXIII, rule 1(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure.

9. Impugning the judgment and order dated 18-7-2017 passed in Civil Revision No. 776 of 2016, rejecting the plaint of Other Suit No. 450 of 2014, the plaintiff filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 3902 of 2018 and obtained leave which giving rise to this appeal.

10. Mr. Probir Neogi, the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants submits that the High Court Division was wrong in making the Rule absolute relying on additional documents other than the plaint itself inasmuch as it is a settled principle that while disposing of an application under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the statements and averments made in the plaint only and nothing beyond the plaint are to be considered and relied upon.

11. He further submits that the decree in Other Suit No. 41 of 1992 in favour of the predecessor of the defendant respondents No. 1 and 2 having been obtained against Sree Kali Shankar and his two brothers for specific performance of contract, and the present plaintiff-petitioner/his predecessor was neither a party to the said suit nor having not claimed the suit property through those judgment debtors, the said decree cannot operate as resjudicata against the present plaintiff-appellant.

12. He further submits that the decree obtained by the predecessor of defendant-respondent No. 1 and 2 in Other Suit No. 41 of 1992 being a decree passed in a suit for specific performance of contract, and the present suit being one for declaration of title and other reliefs, the decree in Other Suit No. 41 of 1992 cannot operate as resjudicata inasmuch as it is settled in a long line of decisions including CQ MH Md Ayub Ali vs Bangladesh, 47 DLR (AD) 71 that the decree in a suit for specific performance of contract only decides the controversy between the vendor and the vendee as to the genuineness of contract and its enforceability, and such decree is not one deciding title to the suit property.

13. He further submits that the High Court Division was wrong in rejecting the plaint inasmuch as it is settled in many cases including Abdur Rahman and others vs Kheru Malitha and others, 50 DLR (AD) 71: 5 BLT (AD) 217 that the withdrawal of suit by necessary implication blots out the effect of the judgment and decrees prior to withdrawal, and as such by withdrawal of Title Suit No. 91 of 1995 by Porikkhit, the vendor of the plaintiff-appellant, both the judgments and decree of the trial Court and appellate Court were blotted out, and the present suit by the plaintiff-appellant on new causes of action is not barred.

14. Next he submits that the High Court Division was wrong in making the Rule absolute and rejecting the plaint inasmuch as the application filed by the defendants for rejection of plaint was on the ground of the suit being barred by resjudicata, and it is an elementary principle of law settled by a long line of decisions including Mahbubul Hague vs Md A. Kader Munshi, 52 DLR (AD) 49 and Sreemoti Pushpa Rani Das vs AkM Habibur Rhaman and others 1993 BLD (AD) 217 that the question of resjudicata being a mixed question of law and fact can only be resolved by taking evidence, and as such the plaint cannot be rejected on the defendants' plea of resjudicata.

15. On the other hand Mr. Subrata Chowdhury, the learned Senior Advocate appearing with Mr. M Qumrul Hoque Siddique, the learned Advocate for the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 submits that admittedly the plaintiff purchased the suit land from Prokshit Banik, the sole heir of the tenants recorded in concerned RS Khatians by registered Kobala deed No. 1655 dated 24-8-1997, during pendency of Civil Revision No. 4756 of 1995 in the High Court Division and as such his Kobala was hit by Lis Pendens under section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.

16. He further submits that the Rule issued in Civil Revision No. 4756 of 1995 was made absolute by judgment dated 16-5-2010, which was affirmed in Civil Petition No. 81 of 2011 by judgment dated 12-6-2014 and Civil Review petition No. 97 of 2014 by judgment dated 6-4-2016 and thereby Sudhir Chandra Banik acquired title based on the decree for specific performance of contract for sale executed by the heirs of the tenants recorded in the RS Khatians and the present appellant Sree Suvash Chandra Dhar deposed as DW 2 in the said suit No. 41 of 1991.

17. He further submits that the appellant, knowing fully well that, father of Porikkhit i.e. Kashi Mohon and his brother Ananta Mohon had sold their land to Mohendra Lal Dey by registered Kobala deed dated 29-8-1934 and Porikkhit did not inherit any land, but still he created the collusive purchase deed dated 24-8-1997 with malafide intention to frustrate the decree passed in Other Suit No. 41 of 1992.

18. Next he submits that the present appeal, originating from the decree of Other Suit No. 450 of 2014, is merely a collusive and fraudulent attempt to frustrate the judgment and decree passed in Other Suit No. 41 of 1992, affirmed by this Division in Civil Review Petition No. 97 of 2014.

19. Mr. M. Qumrul Haque Siddique, the learned Advocate for the respondents in support of his contention has placed reliance in the decision of Abdul Jalil and others vs Islamic Bank Bangladesh Lid 53 DLR (AD) 12, Shahjahan Siraj vs Md Rafique Quoraishi and others 2 ALR (AD) 202 and so on.

20. We have heard the learned Advocates of both sides at length and perused the relevant laws and decisions together with the papers/documents contained in the paper book.

21. For better understanding let us first discuss the relevant provisions of laws on the issue.

22. Firstly, Order VII, rule 11 of the Code enjoins:

"Rule 11-Rejection of plaint-The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:-
(a) where it does not disclose a cause of action;
(b) where the relief claimed is undervalued, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so;
(c) where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so;
(d) where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law;"
23. With regards to the question of withdrawal of a suit Order XXIII, rule 1 of the Code is reproduced below:

"1. Withdrawal of suit or abandonment of part of claim.
(1) At any time after the institution of a suit, the plaintiff may as against all or any of the defendants abandon his suit or abandon a part of his claim.
(2) Where the Court is satisfied,
(a) That a suit must fail by reason of some formal defect, or
(b) That there are sufficient grounds for allowing the plaintiff to institute a fresh suit for the subject-matter of a suit or part of a claim,
it may, on such terms as it thinks fit, grant the plaintiff permission to withdraw from such suit or such part of the claim with liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect of the subject-matter of such suit or such part of the claim.
(3) Where the plaintiff withdraws from a suit or part of a claim, without the permission referred to in sub-rule (2), he shall be liable for such costs as the Court may award and shall be preclude from instituting any fresh suit in respect of such subject-matter or such part of the claim.
(4) Nothing in this rule shall be deemed to authorise the Court to permit one of several plaintiffs to withdraw without the consent of the others."
24. Besides, section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act enjoins:

"52. During the pendency in any Court in Bangladesh, of any suit or proceeding which is not collusive and in which any right to immoveable property is directly and specifically in question, the property cannot be transferred or otherwise dealt with by any party to the suit or proceeding so as to affect the rights of any other party thereto under any decree or order which may be made therein, except under the authority of the Court and on such terms as it may impose."
25. In the Case of Sumon Paul vs Binode Kumar Mali 5 LM (AD) 2018 139 his Lordship Mr. Muhammad Imman Ali, J observed:

"The High Court Division observed that it is true 'that a plaint of a suit should not be rejected under order 7 rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure only on point of res-judicata. But the facts of the present case are quite different. Apparently it shows that the predecessor of the plaintiffs-opposite parties lost their title up to Appellate Division and after settling dispute finally by the Appellate Division the present plaintiff-opposite parties purchased some lands in 2009 from the predecessor of the defendants of the former suit and they instituted present suit for declaration of title, confirmation of possession and for further declaration that the decree passed in previous Title Suit No. 235 of 1972 against the predecessor of the present plaintiffs are void and not binding upon them. The issue of present title suit was decided by the Court finally in previously instituted suit and that issue cannot be agitated in the subsequently suit.

The High Court Division concluded that the present plaintiffs-opposite parties having knowledge about the previous suit and having lost their title up to this Division, instituted the present suit which is nothing but a futile exercise.

Having considered the facts and circumstances discussed above, we are of the view that the High Court Division has properly considered the relevant law and facts involved in the case."
26. The same point has also been established in the case of Shahjahan Siraj vs Md Rafique Quoraishi and others reported in 2 ALR (AD) 202:

"What is important to note here is that the learned Additional District Judge rejected the plaints of both the suits as according to him those were barred under section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This is not the correct exposition of law. The plea of res judicata is to be decided after framing an issue to that effect. There is no scope for application of section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of plaint.

Having gone through the plaints of both the suits, we are of the view that the plaints of both the suits were rightly rejected by the learned Additional District Judge but that should have been done by resorting to the provision of section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore, the plaints of both the suits shall be deemed to have been rejected under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure as the materials on record justify to do so. We are of the view that the ultimate decision made by learned Additional District Judge and the learned Single Judge are based on proper appreciation of materials on record."
27. In the decision of Abdul Jalil and others vs Islamic Bank Bangladesh Ltd. 53 DLR (AD) 12 it has been held:

"It is well settled now that a plaint may be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure merely on a plain reading of the plaint but in exceptional circumstances the Court may invoke its inherent jurisdiction and can throw the plaint out in limini. It is also well settled that the plea of implied bar should be decided on evidence unless the fact disclosed in the plaint clearly indicate that the suit is not maintainable. In exceptional cases recourse may be taken even under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is also well settled that in an application for rejection of plaint on the ground of undisclosed cause of action the Court should not dissect the plaintiffs case part by part. "
28. In the land mark decision of Chowmuhani College vs Md Ismail Hossain 26 DLR 10 it has also been observed on the question of maintainability with reference to Order VII, rule 11 of the Code as under:

"to my mind the intention of the legislature in making the provision under Order 7, rule 11 of the Code is very clear and if the same be considered properly with reference to given facts in a case much time of the Court may be saved, parties may be relieved of unnecessary wastage of energy and harassment and they may be directed towards getting proper remedy without having the connected pleasure of prolonged litigation. In this case I have already held that the suit as framed is not maintainable and the said view of mine is supported by the decisions of our Supreme Court as cited above. So it is better that the parties in the instant suit should be relieved of unnecessary harassment."
29. The provision of Order VII, rule 11 of the code mainly enjoins that if on a mere reading of the plaint it is found that the suit is not maintainable the Court has to decide the said point outright. It is also held that Order VII, rule 11 is not exhaustive and the High Court Division in the instant case in exercise of his jurisdiction under section 150 read with 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure can reject the paint. Reliance can be placed in the decisions of Burmah Eastern Ltd., vs Burmah Eastern Employees Union and others 18 DLR 709 wherein it has been observed:

"Coming back to the fact of this case, I would like to say that, on a perusal of the plaint, there can be no doubt that the suit is incompetent. The plaint should be rejected out-right even if it is held that the ground for its rejection is not fully covered by express language of Order VII, rule 11, of the Code of Civil Procedure. What useful purpose would be served by allowing the defendant to file a written statement and, thereafter, to dismiss the suit after raising a contested Issue to the effect that the suit is incompetent, when the plaint itself discloses a suit which is not countenanced by law? If the suit is prohibited and its incompetency is evident from a mere reading of the plaint, it (plaint) should be rejected. Under clause (d) of rule 11 of Order VII, the Court is required to reject a plaint where the suit appears, from the statements in the plaint, to be barred by any law. In the present case although the suit may not be expressly barred by section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, the contention is that is la barred under law having regard to the requirement of the said section, namely, section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. If as a result of the provisions of law, the suit is barred, it would be barred under law, although, strictly speaking, it may not be specifically barred by law in express terms. The Court should, in such a case, reject the plaint under its inherent power."
30. In Burmah Eastern case as referred to above it was further held that "a still born baby should be buried at once" a proverbial legal proposition governing this field.

31. Now if we go back at the beginning of the litigations we would see that Sudhir Chandra Banik father of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 of the present suit being Other Suit No. 450 of 2014 instituted Other Suit No. 45 of 1990 against recorded tenants of the holding, which on successive transfer was lastly renumbered as Other Suit No. 41 of 1992 and was decreed. The said decree was reversed in Other Appeal No. 521 of 1992 but the decree was restored in Civil Revision No. 4756 of 1995 and affirmed by the Appellate Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 81 of 2011 and Civil Review petition No. 97 of 2014. The decree has been put into execution in other Execution Case No. 1 of 2014.

32. Admittedly, the plaintiff-appellant claimed to have purchased the suit land from Porkkhit Banik, the predecessor in interest of the defendant Nos. 10 to 12 of the present suit by a sale deed being No. 1655 dated 24-8-1997. Porikkhit Banik prior to sale of the suit land to the plaintiff of the present suit instituted Other Suit No. 98 of 1992 for determination of title and confirmation of possession, which on transfer was re-numbered as Other Suit No. 91 of 1995 and was decreed. Sudhir Chandra Banik father of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 preferred Other Appeal No. 153 of 1996, which was allowed and the decree was reversed. Porikkhit Banik preferred Civil Revision No. 4903 of 1999 against the said appellate decree but anticipating defeat on 11-5-2010 he withdrew the said Civil Revision No. 4903 of 1999. While allowing the withdrawal, the High Court Division set-aside the judgment and decree of the Appellate Court as well as the Trial Court. The contents of the application for withdrawal was to the effect that on perusal of the record the plaintiff appellant have understood that they should not have filed the suit now on proper understating of overall situation have decided not to proceed with the suit. The transferor of the present plaintiff did not seek any permission to release the suit due to any formal defect or any other reasons, rather it has been mentioned in clearest terms that they should not have filed the suit and decided not to proceed with the same.

33. Now it is to be considered in the absence of any leave from the Court whether a fresh suit can be instituted by the same person against transferee claiming title in the suit since no permission was taken for instituting a fresh suit.

34. It appears that Porikkhit Banik who filed the earlier suit transferred the suit land in favour of the present plaintiff who after purchase again filed the suit seeking declaration of title, permanent injunction and other identical reliefs being made in the earlier suit. It is clear that the vendor of the plaintiff filed suit No. 41 of 1992. Since vendor of the present plaintiff withdrew Revisional application as well as his suit, the present plaintiff is not entitled to file the instant suit.

35. The High Court Division clearly observed that the plaintiff claimed the suit land by purchase from Porikkhit Banik by Registered Kabala deed No. 1655 dated 24-8-1997. Porikkhit instituted Other suit No. 98 of 1992 in the 5th Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Chattogram for declaration of title, confirmation of possession and perpetual injunction and got decree, but on appeal on Other appeal No. 153 of 1996 the decree was reversed against which Porkshit Banik filed Civil Revision No. 4903 of 1999 in the High Court Division but later on he withdrew the civil Revision on 11-5-2010 without any permission to sue afresh and as such the suit stands precluded under Order XXIII, rule 1(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure.

36. Since, no permission is accorded for instituting fresh suit, the present suit filed by the transferee of the previous plaintiff is not maintainable.

37. It is fairly established here that the parties indulged in various litigations in different Courts in respect of the suit property and all the proceedings, the present respondents got verdict in his favour. The present appellant is not claiming title otherwise from Porikkhit Banik whose predecessor lost up to the Appellate Division and after loosing in the appeal, Porikkhit Banik himself has withdrawn the revisional application.

38. It is evident that the present appellant Sree Suvash Chandra Dhar as plaintiff filed other suit No. 450 of 2014 against the defendant No. 1 and 2 for declaration of three things as mentioned above who deposed as DW 2 in other Suit No. 41 of 1992 but knowing everything regarding the suit and its fate up to the Appellate Division he instituted the present suit suppressing all the past events.

39. In that suit defendant No. 1 and 2 filed an application under Order VII, rule 11(d) of the code of Civil Procedure for rejection of plaint. The learned Joint District Judge by order No. 11 dated 13-3-2016 rejected the application for rejection of plaint on the ground that resjudicata is a mixed question of facts and law, which can only be decided after adducing evidence at the time of pre-emptory hearing. Against which the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 preferred Civil Revision before the High Court Division and the High Court Division upon hearing the parties made the Rule absolute and rejected the plaint of tide suit No. 450 of 2014.

40. Notably, in the suit being No. 41 of 1992 the present appellant deposed as DW 2 that means the plaintiff appellant knew everything regarding the suit and its fate up to the Appellate Division.

41. As we have already mentioned that Porikkhit Banik from whom the plaintiff appellant purchased the suit land vide deed No. 1655 dated 24-8-1997 filed title suit No. 98 of 1992 which was decreed but on appeal it was reversed against which he filed Civil Revision before the High Court Division, but fearing the fate of the Civil Revision he withdrew the Civil Revision case, therefore, the bar of the provisions of Order XXIII, rule 1(3) would operate, wherein it has been stated that the plaintiff will be precluded from placing any fresh suit if permission is not taken. The purchase of the suit land by the appellant plaintiff from Porikkhit is absolutely a sham transaction being hit by the provision of Lis Pendens enjoins under section 52 of the transfer of property Act as mentioned above.

42. Therefore, if the provisions of Order XXIII, rule 1(3) of the Code read with section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act be considered in juxtaposition with facts and circumstances of the instant case, our view is that it squarely attracts Order VII, rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure and hence High Court Division did not commit any error in the decision by rejecting the plaint in revisional jurisdiction under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

43. Further, the case in hand is indeed of such an impact which as we have discussed above manifestly maintained that the rejection of plaint by the High Court Division was absolutely justified and hence cannot be gainsaid that there is a denial of justice in any manner.

44. The High Court Division has rightly rejected the plaint of Title Suit No. 450 of 2014 pending in the Court of Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Chattogram. The judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is elaborate, speaking and well composed. We are not inclined to interfere with the same.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed Without any order as to costs.

JUDGMENT
M. Enayetur Rahim, J.

1. This appeal, under Article 103(2)(b) of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is directed against the judgment and order dated 05.01.2012 and 08.01.2012 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Criminal Appeal No. 2185 of 2006 heard along with Death Reference No. 43 of 2006 and Jail Appeal Nos. 407, 408, 409, 410, 411 and 412 of 2006 dismissing the Criminal Appeal in part thereby affirmed the judgment and order dated 18.05.2006 passed by the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 2, Bogura so far relates to present-appellants, who were convicted under section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and sentenced each of them to death by hanging until death and also to pay a fine of Taka 1,00,000/-, each.

2. The relevant facts for disposal of the present appeal are as follows:

The present appellants along with 04 others were put on trial before the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 2, Bogura in Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 228 of 2004 and charge was framed against them under section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000.

3. The appellants and other accused pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against them and claimed to be treated.

4. The prosecution case, in a nutshell, are that on the night following 13.08.2000 victim Shahnaj Akhter Banu alias Sumi daughter of Abdus Satter (P.W-1) was in asleep in her father's dwelling hut. At about 11:00 p.m. the accused persons called her out of the house on a pretext to get meet with her paramour Alam. Later on she was raped and killed. Subsequently, the dead body was found by Rofiqul floating in the pond and it was brought to the courtyard of the informant. The body bore multiple injuries having marks of sexual violence. On 14.04.2000 the incident was informed to the father of the victim who was then Station Master at Adomdighi gate No. 4, over telephone by Md. Belayet Hossain alias Nantu (P.W-6). He, then rushed to his home and heard the occurrence from his wife Rowshan Ara Begum (P.W-2) to the effect that. Since 11.00 p.m. victim Sumi was found missing; Sumon son of domestic worker Md. Ashraful (P.W-7), neighbour Rafiqul, and Delower (P.W-4) unsuccessfully searched her and on the following morning her dead body was found inside the pond by Rafiqul.

5. The prosecution was launched by lodging a first information report by Abdus Sattar (P.W-1) as informant which was recorded as Adamdighi Police Station case No. 9 dated 14.08.2000 corresponding to G.R. No. 90 of 2000.

6. The police after conducting investigation submitted charge sheet against 06(six) persons including the present appellants under section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000.

7. At the trial the prosecution in all examined 13 (thirteen) witnesses to prove the case. The defence cross examined the said witnesses but did not adduce any defense witness.

8. On conclusion of the trial the learned judge of the Tribunal found the present appellants guilty along with 4(four) others under section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and sentenced each of them to hang till death and also fine of taka 1,00,000/-.

9. In view of the provision of section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the learned Judge of the Tribunal made reference to the High Court Division for confirmation of the death sentence. The said reference was registered as Death Reference No. 43 of 2006. All the convicts had preferred Criminal Appeal No. 2185 of 2006 and present appellants also filed Jail Appeal Nos. 407 of 2006 and 409 of 2006 respectively. The other convicts also preferred separate Jail Appeals.

10. A Division Bench of the High Court Division heard the said Death Reference along with the above Criminal Appeal and Jail Appeals and by the impugned judgment and order dated 05.01.2012 and 08.11.2012 accepted the reference in part and maintained the sentence of death of the present appellants and acquitted the other convicts from the charges brought against them.

11. Accordingly, the Criminal Appeal No. 2185 of 2006 was allowed-in-part and Jail Appeal No. 407 of 2006 and 409 of 2006 were dismissed.

12. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order the present appellants have prepared this appeal.

13. Mr. Md. Jahangir Kabir, learned Advocate appearing for the appellants having referred to the impugned judgment, evidence and other materials on record submits that the prosecution has failed to examine any independent and disinterested witnesses to support its case and thus, the trial court as well as the High Court Division committed serious error in relaying the evidence of the said partisan witnesses.

14. He further submits that no one saw the occurrence and the alleged confessional statement made by appellant-Milon cannot be said to be true and voluntary one. Moreover, at the time of the examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he categorically stated that the said confession was the outcome of torture and coercion; but the High Court Division failed to consider this aspect and maintained the conviction and sentence relaying on the said confessional statement which is not true and voluntary.

15. Mr. Kabir further submits that the trial Court and the High Court Division erred in law in relying on the alleged extra judicial confession made by appellant-Rabiul alias Habul, though such extra judicial confession has got no evidentiary value.

16. On the other hand, Mr. Sayem Mohammad Murad, learned Assistant Attorney General submits that the trial Court and the High Court Division on proper consideration of the evidence and materials on record rightly and legally found the present appellants guilty under section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and there is no illegal or infirmity in the impugned judgment and as such there is no scope to interfere with the same.

17. We have heard the learned Advocates for the respective parties, perused the impugned judgment as well as the evidence and other materials on record.

18. It is true that in the instant case there is no eye witness of the alleged occurrence.

19. The appellant-Milon made a statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate (exhibit-4) which runs as follows:

“আমি আপনার জিজ্ঞাসাবাদে জানাচ্ছি যে, গত ১৩-৮-২০০০ তারিখে দিবাগত রাতে রবিউল পিতা-হাবু, হেলাল পিতা-আলেফ, আসলাম পিতা-নজরুল ওরফে নজু, যুসাদ্দেক পিতা-মনসের, মান্নান পিতা-সামাদ এবং আমি রাত অনুমান ১১-০০ টার দিকে আমাদের প্রাননাথপুর গ্রামের সাত্তারের বাড়ির খোলানে যাই। হেলাল ও রবিউল সাত্তারের মেয়ে শাহনাজ যে ঘরে থাকে সেই ঘরের জানালায় দিয়ে টোকা মারে এবং শাহনাজকে বলে তার প্রেমিক আলম এসেছে। শাহনাজ তার ঘর থেকে বের হয় এবং মই দিয়ে বাড়ির প্রাচীরের উপরে উঠে এবং আসলাম শাহনাজকে হাত দিয়ে ধরে প্রাচীরের বাইরে নামায় । আমাদের সঙ্গে অল্প কিছু দূরে অনুমান ২০/২৫ হাত যাওয়ার পরে শাহনাজ আলমের কথা জিজ্ঞেস করে । আলম পুকুর পাড়ে বলে হেলাল জানায় । আসলাম কাপড় দিয়ে শাহনাজের মুখ চেপে ধরে এবং হেলাল শাহনাজকে পাজাকোলা করে শাহনাজ ওরফে সুমির পিতার বাড়ির পূর্ব দিকে অবস্থিত মান্নানের পিতার বনপাতির জমিতে নিয়ে যায়। আমি নিকটবর্তাঁ পুকুরের পাড়ে বসে পাহাড়ায় ছিলাম যাতে অন্য লোকজন টের না পায়। প্রথমে হেলাল, তারপর আসলাম, তারপর মুসাদ্দেক, তারপর রবিউল, তারপর মান্নান এবং সর্বশেষ আমি শাহনাজকে হাত পা জোর করে রেখে এবং মুখে কাপড় চেপে ধরে ধর্ষণ করা হয়। ধর্ষণের পরে আসলাম ও হেলাল শাহনাজের ওড়না দিয়ে ওখানেই শাহনাজের গলায় ফাস লাগায় গলায় পেঁচিয়ে ৷ মারার সময় মান্নান শাহনাজের পা ও রবিউল হাত ধরে ছিল। মুসাদ্দেক আমাকে এই ঘটনা প্রকাশ করতে নিষেধ করে । হেলাল আমাকে বলে যে এই ঘটনা ফাস করলে তোকে মারব। হেলাল, আসলাম ও রবিউল এই তিন জন শাহনাজের লাশ সাত্তারের পুকুরের পূর্ব পাড়ে নিয়ে আসে হাত দিয়ে তুলে ধরে। শাহনাজের লাশ তারা পুকুরের পূর্ব পাড়ে রাখে পানিতে, মাথাটির কিছু অংশ পানির উপরে পুকুরের পাড়ে মাটিতে ছিল। আমরা সবাই চলে গেলাম। আমি বাড়িতে গেলাম। পরদিন বিকেলে আমি বিরামপুরে যাই ।”

20. P.W-11, Md. Alamin, Magistrate, 1st Class recorded said confessional statement of appellant-Milon. P.W.-11 in his deposition categorically and consistently stated that he recorded the said statement after complying all the legal requirements as laid down under section 364 and 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He proved said confessional statement of appellant-Milon, as exhibits-4 and his 10 signatures thereon, as exhibits-4/1-4/10. He also proved the thump impression of appellant-Milon thereon.

21. P.W-11 was duly cross-examined by the defense but nothing could be elicited to shake his credibility in any manner whatsoever. Moreover, at the time of recording the statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure appellant-Milon did not say anything to the recoding magistrate about the alleged torture on him by the police before recording the said statement. Further, it emerges from the record that the appellant-Milon was arrested on 02.09.2000 and on the very same day he was produced before the Magistrate, P.W-11 and his confessional statement was recorded on the same day.

22. As such, the appellant-Milon's plea at the time of examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that his confessional statement was not true and voluntary and he was compelled to make such statement before the Magistrate is not at all tenable.

23. We have also scrutinized Exhibit 4 as well as the evidence of PW 11. The Magistrate after recording the confessional statement of appellant-Milon certified (স্মারক মন্তব্য) to the effect:

“আমি আসামী মিলনকে বুঝিয়ে দিয়েছি যে, তিনি দোষ স্বীকার করতে বাধ্য নন এবং যদি তিনি তা করেন তাহলে তা তার বিরুদ্ধে সাক্ষ্য হিসেবে ব্যবহৃত হতে পারে । আমি বিশ্বাস করি যে, এই দোষ স্বীকারোক্তি স্বেচ্ছা মূলকভাবে করা হয়েছে। তিনি তা নির্ভুল বলে স্বীকার করেছেন এবং তিনি তা বিবৃতি দিয়েছে, তাতে তার পূর্ণাঙ্গ ও সত্য বিবরণ রয়েছে ।”
24. Column 8 of the form has been filed by the PW 11 in following manner:

“যেহেতু আসামীকে বিকেল ৪ টা থেকে সন্ধ্যা দেয়া হয় এবং এই ফর্মের ৬ নং ক্রমিকে উল্লিখিত প্রশ্নগুলো করার পরও আসামী দোষ স্বীকারোক্তিমূলক জবানবন্দি প্রদান করেছেন । কাজেই আমি মনে করি যে, আসামী স্বেচ্ছায় এই দোষ স্বীকারোক্তিমূলক জবানবন্দি প্রদান করেছেন । আসামীর শরীরে কোনও প্রকার জখম ও আঘাতের চিহ দেখা যায়নি”
25. In view of the above, we have no doubt about the truth and voluntariness of the confessional statement (exhibit-4) of appellant-Milon.

26. It is now well settled principle of law that judicial confession if it is found to be true and voluntary can form the sole basis of conviction as against the maker of the same. [Reference: Islamuddin (Md) alias Din Islam Vs. The State, 13 BLC(AD) page-81, Hazrat Ali and others Vs. The State 44 DLR(AD), page-51].

27. In view of the above proposition, we have no hesitation to concur with the findings of the High Court Division as well as the trial Court that the confessional statement (exhibit-4) made by appellant-Milon is true and voluntarily and relying on the same conviction can be awarded safely.

28. In the case of State Vs. Abdul Kader alias Mobail Kader, 67 DLR (AD), 6, this Division has held that retraction of a confession has no bearing whatsoever if it was voluntarily made so far the maker is concerned.

29. At the time of examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the plea of appellant-Milon that the alleged confessional statement made by him is outcome of torture by the police has got no legal basis, rather in our opinion said plea is afterthought and brain child of the learned Advocate for the defence.

30. Moreover, immediate after the occurrence convict-Milon fled away from the village and he was arrested from another place. Form this circumstances we may also draw inference about his involvement in the Commission of offence.

31. In the instant case it is the prosecution case that victim-Shahnaj Akter Banu @ Shumi was killed after she had been being raped by the accused persons.

32. P.W-12 Dr. Nehar Ranjan Mozumder, held autopsy upon the cadaver of victim-Shahnaj Akter Banu. She proved the post mortem report and his signature thereon, exibits-5 and 5/1 respectively.

33. P.W-12 found the following injuries;

One continuous, transverse ligature mark present below the thyroid cartilage, breadth 1/2"
One bruise on the tip of nose, size "3/4 X 1/2".
One bruise on the back of left elbow joint, size 1" X 1/2".
Multiple bruises on the upper and medial aspect of both thighs of various sizes.
Multiple seratch abrasions on the upper and medial aspect of both thighs and genitalia of various sizes.
Extensive bruise in the labia majora and minora of both side and vaginal canal.
On detailed dissection extravasations of clotted blood found present at the side of the injuries. The skin, soft tissue, muscles, trachea were found highly congested. Hyod bone both cornu was found fractured. Uterus empty. Stomach contains semi digested food. All the visceras were found highly congested. High vaginal swab was taken for pathological examination and sent to the department of pathology. S.Z.M.C. Bogra, as per memo. No. SZMC/PM/2000/265, dated 16.08.2000. Doctor opined that death was due to asphyxia as a result of strangulation by ligature following forceful sexual act on her which was ante mortem and homicidal in nature.

34. The above autopsy report manifests that the victim-Shahnaj was killed after she being raped. Thus, the prosecution has been successfully able to prove that manner of occurrence that the victim was murdered after she being raped.

35. P.Ws-3, 5, 6 and 7 in their respective depositions categorically stated that on the morning of 13.08.2000 Rafiqul found the dead body in the pond and thereafter her dead body was taken to the house of the informant. The witnesses found marks of violence on the body of victim. The said witnesses further deposed that Rabiul's father nabbed Rabiul and in presence of the village peoples said Rabiul disclosed that he along with the other accused committed the alleged occurrence.

36. P.W-7 Md. Ashraful in his deposition stated that when Rabiul made the said statement it was recorded by them in a tape recorder cassette and the said cassette was produced before the Tribunal and marked as material exhibit-VI.

37. In cross-examination, PW 3 Md Yar Ali asserted to the effect;

“রবিউলের স্বীকারোক্তির সময় আমি, বাদী সাত্তার সহ অন্যান্য লোক ছিল। আসামী রবিউল স্ব-ইচ্ছায় স্বীকারোক্তিমূলক জবানবন্দি দিয়েছে । রবিউলের দেওয়া জবানবন্দি আর লিখি নাই। তাহার জবানবন্দি ক্যাসেটবন্দী করা হয় ।”

38. PW 5 Md Ayub Hossain in his cross-examination also asserted to the effect;

“রবিউল ওরফে হবুলকে তাহার বাবা ধরিয়া আনে এই কথা পুলিশের নিকট বলিয়াছি। হবুলের বক্তব্য ক্যাসেট করার কথা পুলিশের নিকট সাক্ষ্য কালে বলিয়াছি।”
39. PW 6 Md Belayet Hossain alias Nantu also asserted his communication-in-chief in cross-examination to the effect:

“আমার সামনে হবুলের কথা রেকর্ড করা হয়। সেই সময় আমি উপস্থিত ছিলাম । এই সেই রেকর্ডিং ক্যাসেট যোহা শোনা হয়) এই ক্যাসেটটিতে যে কথা শোনা গেল তাহা আসামী হবুলের কণ্ঠ । এই ক্যাসেট (ফিতা) বন্ধু প্রদর্শনী-৬] (যাহাতে আসামী হবুলের কণ্ঠ রেকর্ড করা আছে ।)”
40. PW 7 Md Ashraful in his cross-examination also stated to the effect:

“হবুলের পিতা তাকে ধরিয়ে দেয়। হবুল ধরাপরার পর সে সকলের সামনে স্বীকারোক্তি দেয় যে, দে সহ অন্যরা সুমিকে ধর্ষণ করে খুন করেছে । হবুলের সেই স্বীকারোক্তি ক্যাসেট করা হয়। তখন আমি উপস্থিত ছিলাম ।”

41. The above evidence of the witnesses are very consistent and corroborative in nature and the defence has failed to shake their credibility of the said witness of the said witnesses. As such, it is proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution that the father of the Habul alias Rabiul nabbed his son and in presence of the villagers Rabiul made extra judicial confession as to his involvement along with the other accused in commission of the offence. If we consider this aspect along with the confessional statement, exhibit-4 made by the appellant-Milon, then we have no hesitation to hold that the appellant-Milon and Rabiul were involved with the commission of the alleged offence of rape and murder.

42. Mr. Jahngir Kabir, learned Advocate appearing for the appellant submits that the alleged extra judicial confession made by the Rabiul alias Habul in presence of the villagers has got no evidentiary value and the trial court as well as the High Court Division have committed serious error in relying on such statement in finding the guilty of appellant Habul alias Rabiul.

43. In the case of Nausher Ali Sarder and others vs. The State, 39 DLR (AD), 194, this Division has observed that since the accused made extrajudicial confession to the witnesses before arrival of the 'Dafadar' this confessional statement is voluntary and true as it agrees with the established facts of the case.

44. In the said judgment (paragraph-8) this Division observers:

"Mr. Serajul Huq has tried to bring this confessional statement within the mischief of sections 25 and 26 of the Evidence Act which make any confession to, or in custody of, a police officer inadmissible. After Nausher was caught and detained in the shop of Toyeb Ali, local Dafadar (P.W. 13) appeared and also questioned him about the reason of his being present and caught there. Mr. Serajul Huq contends that this statement was made in presence of and during custody of a police officer, which expression includes a Chowkidar/Dafadar. This attempt by the learned Counsel is found to be an exercise in futility, for the evidence of Toyeb Ali and Akram Ali, read with evidence of Dafadar Hasen Ali, clearly shows, that the statement was made, first of all, to Toyeb Ali and Akram Ali before the arrival of the Dafadar. If any further statement had been made when the Dafadar arrived, the earlier statement would not be affected as it was made not in presence of, or while the accused was in custody of, the police. This confessional statement is voluntary and true as it agrees with the established facts of the case."

45. In this particular case, P.Ws-3, 5, 6 and 7 in their respective dispositions and cross-examinations categorically stated that in presence of the village peoples Rabiul alias Habul confessed his guilt in commission of the alleged offence. Further, statement of Rabiul was recorded in tape recorder cassette, material exhibit-VI. Defence did not put any suggestion to the said witnesses to the effect that at the time of making such statement by Rabiul, police personnel were also present.

46. If we consider the evidence of said P.Ws coupled with the proposition of law as enunciated in the case of Nausher Ali Sarder and others vs. The State, then we are of the opinion that the extra judicial confession made by appellant-Rabiul has got evidentiary value and we can safely rely on the same in awarding conviction of its maker.

47. In the case of State Vs. Abdul Kader @ Mobile Kader, 67 DLR(AD)6 this Division in interpreting section 30 of the Evidence Act has held that when more than one person are being tried jointly for the same offence and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the Court may take into consideration such confession as against such other of such persons as well as against the person who makes such confession.

48. In this particular case confession of convict-Milon lends support to the extrajudicial confession of convict-Rabiul.

49. Having considered and discussed as above, we are of the view that in maintaining of conviction of the present appellants under section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 the High Court Division did not commit any error and illegality and as such there is no scope to set aside the order of conviction.

50. However, having considered the proposition of law settled in the case of Nalu Vs. The State, reported in 17 BLC(AD), 204 in regard to award sentence coupled with the attending facts and circumstances of the present case, in particular, at the time of the alleged occurrence the appellants were just attended in majority, and that Milon in his confession stated that he did not take part in murdering the victim rather other two accused namely Aslam and Helan, who were acquitted by the High Court Division and the State did not prefer any appeal against such acquittal, killed the victim by pressing her neck, and that the appellants are in death cell for about 17 years and during that period the appellants have suffered great mental agony, and that the father of Rabiul having nabbed him handed over to the villagers on coming to know about his involvement with the commission of the offence, we are of the view that justice would be best served if the sentence of death is commuted to one imprisonment for life.

51. Accordingly, the sentence of both the appellants is commuted from death to one imprisonment for life with a fine of Tk. 1,00,000 (one lac) each, in default to suffer imprisonment for 5(five) years more. The Jail Authority is directed to shift the appellants from death cell to normal cell.

52. Accordingly, with the above modification of sentence, the appeal is dismissed.

JUDGMENT
Md. Abu Zafor Siddique, J.

1. Delay of 12 days in filing the civil petition for leave to appeal is hereby condoned.

2. This civil petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 10-4-2017 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Rule No. 84(CON)/2015) thereby making the Civil Rule discharged.

3. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the respondents as plaintiffs, instituted Other Class Suit No. 92 of 2007 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Netrokona which on transfer was renumbered as Other Class Suit No. 120 of 2010 against the petitioners as defendants for mandatory injunction stating, inter alia, that one Abdul Motaleb and others instituted the Title Suit No. 5 of 1983 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Netrokona, for declaration of the title of the suit property along with declaration that the RoR in the name of the Government is wrong and erroneous and ultimately got decree. Against which the Government preferred Other Class Appeal No. 100 of 1985, which was dismissed on contest Present respondent No. 3, Siraj Ali, one of the plaintiffs, on 5-6-1995 sold 1.32 acres land to plaintiff No. 1, Abdul Jalil. On 31-8-1996 Abdul Motaleb sold 12 1/2 decimals land to plaintiff No. 3 by registered deed, Suruz Ali sold 40 decimals land to plaintiff No. 1 on 18-7-2001 and on 20-2-2003 one Abdul Kadir sold 1.60 acres land to plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2 by registered deed and on 27-5-2003 Jamal Uddin sold his land to plaintiff No. 1. In this way, plaintiff No. 1 possessed 3.84 1/2 acres scheduled land and went to pay rent but the defendants refused to accept the same on the plea mat a case is pending in the High Court Division regarding the claim of the land and, as such, the plaintiffs instituted the instant suit.

4. Defendant Nos. 1-4 filed written statements denying all the material allegations made in the plaint contending, inter alia, that the suit is not maintainable as framed; there is no cause of action in the suit; the plaintiffs have no title, possession in the suit land and the suit is barred by limitation. They stated that the land was correctly recorded in the name of Government khas khatian in 1962 as bill category, and one Abdul Motaleb did not take any step to get the record amended and rather he filed Other Class Suit No. 53 of 1983 in the Court of Sub-ordinate Judge and illegally and fancy fully got decree of the suit Local people have been using the water of the suit property from long time and the plaintiffs filed this suit on false statement with intent to grab the Government properties and, as such, the suit is liable to be dismissed.

5. After hearing the parties and considering the materials on record, the Assistant Judge, Netrokona, by the judgment and decree dated 31-1-2011 dismissed the suit Being aggrieved, the plaintiffs preferred Other Appeal No. 99 of 2011 before the District Judge, Netrokona, which was heard by the Additional District Judge, Netrokona, who by his judgment and decree dated 18-6-2013 allowed the appeal, setting aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court.

6. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and decree of the appellate Court, the defendants as petitioners moved the High Court Division under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure causing a delay of 403 days and obtained Rule on delay, which upon hearing the parties was discharged. Hence, the defendants are now before us having filed the instant civil petition for leave to appeal for redress.

7. Mr. Md. Zahangir Alam, learned Deputy Attorney-General appeared on behalf of the leave-petitioners submitted that the defendant-petitioners being the Government machinery it had to move different offices for necessary opinion and directions for filing a revisional application/appeal before the appropriate Court, and for such reasons delay in filing the revisional application has been caused which is bona fide and unintentional but the High Court Division without considering this aspect discharged the Rule by the judgment which is liable to be and, as such,. He submitted that the land in question had been recorded in the khas khatian in 1962 as bill category and the water of the bill is being used by local people in general and the plaintiffs filed the suit only to grab the Government khas land and the trial Court rightly dismissed the suit but the appellate Court reversed the same without considering the case of the defendants Government which is not maintainable in law, and, as such, the High Court Division without considering the merit of the case discharged the Rule without condoning the delay. He submitted that even in the absence of any application for condonation of delay, the Court has the inherent power to condone the delay in an appropriate case for proper administration of justice and, as such, he prays for the sake of justice in condoning the delay by setting aside the judgment and order impugned in this civil petition.

8. Mr. Md. Moinul Islam, learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the respondents made submissions in support of the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.

9. We have considered the submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney-General for the leave-petitioners and the learned Advocate for the respondents, perused the impugned judgment and order along with other connected papers on record.

10. It appears that the scheduled land of the suit was recorded in khas khatian in the name of the Government in 1962. The present respondents instituted Other Class Suit No. 92 of 2007 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Netrokona for mandatory injunction on the suit land as described in schedules 1 and 2 of the plaint. Subsequently, the suit was transferred to the Assistant Judge, Khaliajuri, Netrokona and renumbered as Other Class Suit No. 120 of 2010. Present leave petitioners as defendant Nos. 1 to 4 filed written statements denying all the material allegations made in the plaint contending, inter alia, that the suit land has been recorded in khas khatian No. 1 since 1962. Subsequently, SA and RoR records were prepared in the name of the Government as bill category and, as such, the local people are using the water from the said bill for cultivating crops in the adjacent lands. However, the defendants prayed for dismissal of the suit.

11. After hearing the parties and on perusal of the materials on record, the learned Assistant Judge, Khaliajuri, Netrokona, by the judgment and decree dated 31-1-2011 dismissed the suit. Thereafter, the plaintiffs (respondents herein) preferred Other Class Appeal No. 99 of 2011 before the learned District Judge, Netrokona, which was ultimately heard and allowed by the learned Additional District Judge, Netrokona, by the judgment and decree dated 18-6-2013 upon reversing the judgment and decree so passed by the learned Assistant Judge and thereby decreeing the suit.

12. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree of the appellate Court, the leave petitioners moved to the High Court Division under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure but in filing the same, there had been a delay of 403 days and, as such, an application under section 5 of the Limitation Act was filed along with the said revisional application.

13. It appears from the application under section 5 of the Limitation Act that on the day of passing the judgment and decree on 18-6-2013 the defendant petitioners applied for certified copies of the judgment and thereafter, they were notified for requisite on 21-8-2013. The defendant petitioners obtained the same on 22-8-2013.

14. Thereafter, the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Netrokona, transmitted the file to the office of the Solicitor on 29-8-2013 and the learned Solicitor, after following the necessary formalities, sent the same to the office of the learned Attorney-General on 25-9-2013. Thereafter, an Assistant Attorney-General was entrusted with the file for drafting, who after exhausting the necessary formalities and preparing the draft, sworn in the affidavit on 30-11-2014 and, as such, in the meantime, delay of 403 days had occurred.

15. But the High Court Division upon hearing the learned Advocate dismissed the Rule without considering the explanation offered by the defendant petitioners in the application under section 5 of the Limitation Act and thereby, the High Court Division erred in law in not appreciating the cause for making the delay. Hence, the civil petition for leave to appeal has been filed for redress.

16. The facts and circumstances clearly indicate that the different offices of the Government are so connected that one cannot work without co-operation and assistance from the other. In the instant case, it appears mat the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Netrokona, initiated the proposal to file a revisional application before the High Court Division but it could not do so without obtaining the necessary papers and the opinion of the Government pleader and concerned authority.

17. However, it appears that the record was sent to the office of the Solicitor and thereafter, the record was sent to the office of the learned Attorney-General and then an Assistant Attorney-General was entrusted to take all necessary steps regarding filing of the same in the High Court Division under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. In these circumstances, the reasons for delay of 403 days in filing the revisional application as stated in the application under section 5 of the Limitation Act by the defendant-petitioners cannot be disregarded and discarded simply because the individual would always be quick in taking the decision whether he would pursue the application for condonation of delay since he is a person legally injured. Whereas, the state being impersonal machinery has to work through different offices or servants and from one table to another table in different offices.

18. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case it appears that the delay caused in filing the revisional application was due to the exhaustion of the official formalities and, as such, the same is beyond the control of the defendant petitioners and moreover, the aforesaid delay of 403 days is not an inordinate one and, as such, if the same is not condoned the defendant leave petitioners shall be led to irreparable loss and injury.

19. Having gone through the application under section 5 of the Limitation Act, it appears that the petitioners have properly explained the reasons for which they could not prefer the instant revisional application before the High Court Division in time. And as such, we are of the view that there is no latches or negligence on the part of the petitioners and they have been able to explain the cause of delay in filing revisional application which in our view, fulfills the requirement as spelled out under section 5 of the Limitation Act upto the satisfaction of the Court and, as such, we are inclined to condone the delay.

20. In such view of the matter, the High Court Division erred in not condoning the delay and, as such, the impugned judgment is liable to be and, as such, disposing of the civil petition for leave to appeal.

21. Accordingly, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division is set-aside. The delay of 403 days in filing the revisional application before the High Court Division is condoned. The High Court Division is directed to hear the substantive revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code as In Re motion in accordance with law.

With the aforesaid directions, this civil petition for leave to appeal is disposed of. However, there will be no order as to costs.

Judgment
Hasan Foez Siddique, J: These Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos.605 of 2020, 1009, 1184, 1340 and 1523 of 2021 have been heard together and they are being disposed of by this common judgment and order since the issue involved in all these cases, is almost identical, therefore, we find it expedient to decide the titled cases together. In all the petitions Durnity Daman Commission (hereinafter referred to as Commission) are the petitioners.

2. Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.605 of 2020 is directed against the judgment and order dated 26-1-2020 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.13300 of 2019. Respondent Arif Hassan was the writ petitioner in that writ petition. He obtained Rule in the High Court Division calling upon the writ respondents (Government and others) to show cause as to why the action of the writ respondents in violation of the writ petitioner's fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 27, 31, 32 and 36 of the Constitution by preventing him and imposing embargo upon his leaving Bangladesh should not be declared to be without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and for, a direction upon the writ respondents to allow him to leave and re-enter Bangladesh. The High Court Division upon hearing the parties disposed of the Rule with the direction upon the writ respondents to allow the writ petitioner (bearing Passport No. BY0140253) to go abroad. The High Court Division also directed the writ petitioner-respondent to come back to Bangladesh within three months from the date of his departure for abroad and to inform the writ respondent No.7, Commission about his return to Bangladesh and to file an affidavit-in-compliance without fail.

3. Against the said judgment and order dated 26-1-2020 passed in Writ Petition No.13300 of 2019, the Commission has filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.605 of 2020.

4. Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1009 of 2021 has been filed by the Commission against the judgment and order dated 16-3-2021 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.824 of 2021. The said writ petition was filed by one Md Ataur Rahman @ Ataur Rahman. He obtained Rule calling upon the writ respondents to show cause as to why the order communicated under Nathi No.00.01.0000.501. 01.113.19-31084/1(3) dated 20-12-2020 issued by an Assistant Director of the Commission asking the writ respondent No.5 (Special Police Super, Immigration) (Airport Special Branch, Bangladesh Police) imposing embargo upon the writ petitioner to leave Bangladesh should not be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and was of no legal effect.

5. The High Court Division by a judgment and order dated 16-3-2021 made the Rule absolute with following observations and directions:

“বিতর্কিত আদেশ, সংযুক্তি-এইচ যার দ্বারা কমিশন ইমিগ্রেশন কর্তৃপক্ষ, রেসপন্ডেন্ট নং ৫ কে আবেদনকারী যাতে দেশ ত্যাগ করতে না পারে সে মর্মে ব্যবস্থা গ্রহণের অনুরোধ জানিয়েছিল-তা আইনসঙ্গত কর্তৃপক্ষ ব্যতিরেকে করা হয়েছে এবং এর কোন আইনগত কার্যকারিতা নাই মর্মে ঘোষিত হলো।

তবে আবেদনকারী বিদেশ যেতে চাইলে তিনি কোন ফোন ও ই-মেইল নম্বর কমিশন-কে লিখিতভাবে জানাতে হবে। কমিশন প্রয়োজন মনে করলে অনুসন্ধানের স্বার্থে ই-মেইল ও মোবাইল ফোনে বার্তা দিয়ে যুক্তি সঙ্গত সময় দিয়ে আসামীকে অনুসন্ধান বা তদন্তের স্বার্থে কমিশনের সম্মুখে হাজির হওয়ার নির্দেশ দিতে পারবে। এ ক্ষেত্রে আবেদনকারীকে অবশ্যই কমিশনের সামনে উপস্থিত হতে হবে।”
6. Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1184 of 2001 has been filed against the judgment and order dated 5-5-2021 passed in Writ Petition No.4437 of 2021. Respondent Tafsir Mohammad Awal filed the said Writ Petition in the High Court Division against the Government, Anti-Corruption Commission and others challenging the action of the writ respondents preventing him from going outside Bangladesh. He also challenged the legality of the letter communicated under Memo No.00.01.0000.502. 01.037.20.21479 dated 4-10-2020 issued by the Commission. Filing the aforesaid writ petition, the writ petitioner- respondent obtained Rule and ad-interim order directing the writ respondents to allow him to leave and re- enter Bangladesh for a period of 3(three) months from date subject to no order of restraint or warrant of arrest pending against him. The Commission, against the said ad-interim order dated 5-5-2021 passed in Writ Petition No.4437 of 2021, has filed this Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal.

7. Facts of Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1340 of 2021, in short, are that respondent No.1, GB Hasan as writ petitioner filed Writ Petition No.4162 of 2021 in the High Court Division challenging the order communicated under Memo No. (১৫৬২৫ ঢাকা, প্রধান কার্যালয় ঢাকার নথি নং-দুদক/বিঃ তদন্ত-১/নাঃলঃ প্রঃ/৫৫-২০১৪ dated 18-4-2016 issued by the Commission asking the writ respondent No.5, Special Police Super, Immigration (Airport) Special Branch, Bangladesh Police Dhaka imposing embargo upon his leaving Bangladesh should not be declared unlawful. The High Court Division, by an order dated 2-5-2021, issued Rule and passed ad-interim direction upon the writ respondents to allow the writ petitioner-respondent to leave and re-enter Bangladesh for a period of 6(six) months from date subject to no order of restraint or warrant of arrest pending against him. Impugning the said ad-interim order, the Commission has filed this Civil Petition.

8. Facts, in a nutshell, of Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1523 of 2021 are that respondent No.1 Md Ahsan Habib filed Writ Petition No.1046 of 2021 in the High Court Division challenging the letter communicated under memo No.28923 dated 21-7-2019 issued under the signature writ respondent No.7, Deputy Director of Anti-Corruption Commission so far the same relates to the writ petitioner-respondent imposing embargo upon him to leave and re-enter the country and retention/seizure of the writ petitioner's Passport No.BY0288904 by the office-in-charge (Immigration Police) Special Branch;Hazrat Shahjala International Airport, Dhaka and obtained Rule. The High Court Division, by the impugned judgment and order dated 14-3-2019, disposed of the Rule formulating following guidelines:

That if any person/accused of the schedule offences of the Anti-Corruption Commission, 2004 during pendency of inquiry and/or investigating is debarred from leaving the country and the passport is impounded/seized in an emergency situation without showing any cause and hearing, the Anti-Corruption Commission and/or the investigating officer shall submit an application before the Court of Senior Special Judge/Special Judge for post-approval of the memo of the restraining order and the act of the seizure of the passport as early as possible preferably within 15(fifteen) days from the date of passing the impugned memo as well as from the date of seizing the passport as the case may be.
That the Senior Special Judge/Special Judge having received the application from the Commission if any shall notify the person/accused of cognizable offences and upon hearing the parties may pass necessary order approving or disapproving the memo of restraining order and act of seizure of the passport.
That the learned Special Judge will hear and dispose of the application of the Commission if any as early as possible preferably within 60(sixty) days from the date of receipt of such application providing a fair opportunity of being heard to the aggrieved/parties/persons/ accused.
The aggrieved person/accused shall submit his address, mobile phone and e-mail number to the Commission so that the Commission can communicate with them for any assistance and co-operation if required for the purposes of inquiry and/or investigation and they may appear before the Commission following the reasonable timeframe given by the Commission.
The aggrieved person/accused shall appear before the Commission if asked for to appear before it on the stipulated date fixed by the Commission failing which the matter will be dealt with in accordance with law."
9. The High Court Division also directed the writ respondents with whom the passport of the writ petitioner is lying to return the passport to him so that he can continue his studies going abroad and to allow him to go abroad without any hindrance. Against the said judgment and order, the Commission has preferred instant Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1523 of 2021.

10. Mr AM Aminuddin, learned Attorney-General appeared on behalf of the petitioner in Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos.1009 of 2021, 1184 of 2021, 1340 of 2021 and 1523 of 2021 (He did not appear in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.605 of 2020 since he appeared on behalf of the writ petitioner in Writ Petition No.13300 of 2019 in the High Court Division). Mr AM Fazlul Haque appeared on behalf of the petitioner in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1523 of 2021. Mr Khurshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate appeared for the petitioner in all the civil petitions.

11. On the other hand, Mr Mohammad Arsadur Rouf, learned Advocate appeared for the writ petitioner respondent in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.605 of 2020, Mr Probir Neogi, learned Senior Counsel appeared for the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1009 of 2021. Mr AM Mahbubuddin, learned Advocate appeared for the respondent No.1 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1184 of 2021, Mr Ruhul Quddus, learned Advocate appeared for the respondent No.1 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1340 of 2021 and Mr Murad Reza, learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the respondent No.1 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1523 of 2021.

12. The submissions of the learned Attorney-General, Mr Khurshid Alam Khan and Mr AKM Fazlul Haque, learned Advocates are identical. They submit that the right of freedom of movement as guaranteed under Article 36 of the Constitution is not absolute right and said provision provides specifically that subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by law in the public interest, every citizen shall have the right to move freely throughout Bangladesh, to reside and settle in any place therein and to leave and re-enter Bangladesh. They submit that in view of the words, "subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by law in the public interest", clearly permitted the Government/Commission to impose some restrictions on the movement which are legitimate. In their submissions, learned Attorney-General and Advocates for the petitioner relied upon the preamble of Anti-Corruption Commission Act and Sections 17 and 19 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act. They submit that in order to restrain/obstruct any citizen to leave and re-enter Bangladesh the Commission is authorized to pass necessary order or orders otherwise the object of the Act should be frustrated.

13. On the other hand, all the learned Counsel who appear for the writ petitioner-respondents submit that in view of the provision of Article 36 of the Constitution reasonable restrictions may be imposed to leave and re-enter Bangladesh but the same must be made by law and for public interest, which are absent in all the impugned orders. There is no provision in Anti-Corruption Commission Act authorising the Commission to impose any embargo to move freely throughout Bangladesh and to reside and settle in any place therein and to leave and re-enter in Bangladesh. In absence of specific law, imposition of impugned embargoes upon the writ petitioner respondents were bad in law. They drew our attention to Article 13(1) and (2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in December, 1948 which run as follows:

"Article 13(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his country."
14. They lastly submit that the impugned orders restraining the writ petitioners to leave Bangladesh were bad in law.

15. Freedom of movement, mobility right, or the right to travel is a human right concept encompassing the right of individuals to travel from place to place within the territory of a country and to leave the country and return to it (wikepedia). In 13th Century England, the Magna Carta guaranteed local and foreign merchants the right, subject to some exceptions, to go away from England, come to England, stay and go through England. In Australia O' Connor J. said in Potter vs Minahan [(1908) 7 CLR 277], that a citizen of Australia is entitled to 'depart from and re-enter Australia as he pleases without let or hindrnce unless some law of the Australian Community has in that respect decreed the contrary'. Freedom of movement is included in the compendious term "personal liberty". Freedom of movement is widely considered to be one of the most basic human rights and the same is in the last analysis the essence of personal liberty. However, this right is not absolute. Indeed, freedom is emancipatory in a number of senses. The concept is that the specified right of a citizen is controlled by necessary restrictions in the public interest. No extrinsic aid is needed to interpret the words used in Article 36 of the Constitution which, in our opinion, are not ambiguous. Expression to reasonable restrictions imposed by law must mean restrictions prescribed by the law of the State. The term law is the general sense means law enacted by the legislature. Article 36 of the Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of his right to travel unless the same is restricted reasonably imposed by any law in the public interest. The executive instructions without having the sanction of any statutory power cannot be construed as law. An executive order without the support of valid law depriving a person of his personal liberty cannot be held valid. Learned Attorney-General and other Counsel for the leave petitioners relied upon the following provisions of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act. Section 17 runs as follows:

Section 19 runs as follows:

16. Learned Attorney-General specifically drawing our attention to the preamble and provisions of Section 17(Ta) and 19(Cha) of the Act, submits that object of the Act is to curb corruption in the country and to resist corrupt practice. With an object to implement the ultimate goal, the Commission can take steps so that corrupt people could not leave the country for avoiding legal action/actions brought or to be brought against him.

17. The freedom of movement is subject to reasonable restrictions owing to the rationale that for the society in an orderly manner, people cannot exercise their rights in such a manner which is injurious to the society as a whole because if it is done, it will lead to complete chaos and destroy the basic prerequisite needed for the enjoyment of civil liberties. The rationale behind incorporating reasonable restrictions has been discussed to a great extent in the case of AK Gopalan vs State of Madras (AIR 1950 SC 27). It was observed that reasonable restrictions are imposed on the enjoyment of fundamental rights due to the fact that in certain circumstances, individual liberty has to be subordinated to certain other larger interests of the society.

18. The freedom to travel, like all other freedom couched in universal terms, however, has never remained absolute untrammelled in any state or society. The right of free movement whether within the country or across its frontier, either in going out or coming in is a personal liberty and the same is not intended to bear the narrow interpretation of freedom from physical restrain. The right to travel abroad cannot be deprived unless reasonable restriction is imposed by law in the public interest. Such restriction must be by law and must be reasonably needed in the public interest [Shapiro vs Thompsos (1969) 394 US 618]. Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values. Freedom of travel is indeed an important aspect of the citizen's liberty. William Blackstone characterized the right to leave as part of the common law right to personal liberty. No person can be deprived of his right to go abroad unless appropriate authority exercising its lawful power imposed restriction upon him. If a person's fundamental right under Article 36 is infringed, the State can rely upon a law to sustain the action.

19. All rights in an organized society are relative rather than absolute. With respect to the ambit of reasonable restrictions, the legislative view of what constitute reasonable restriction shall not be conclusive and final and that it shall be subjected to supervision by the Court. It is the duty of the Court to see whether the individual crosses the "Lakshman Rekha" that is carved out by law is dealt appropriately (Dharmendra Kirthal vs State of UP AIR 2013 SC 2569). Most basic rule while testing whether a law falls within the ambit of reasonable restriction is that no general or abstract rule shall be adopted for .the application of all cases. Reasonable implies intelligent care and the deliberation. The legislation which arbitrarily or expressively invests the right cannot be set to contend the quality of reasonableness and unless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guarantee. The restrictions imposed shall have a direct or proximate nexus with the object which the legislature seeks to achieve and the restriction so imposed must not be excessive of the said object.

20. Freedom of movement as envisaged in our Constitution is not absolute meaning thereby that the same is subject to certain limitation. Despite the long standing ideal of free movement, it has in practice always been subject to state restrictions. The right to leave one's country has never been considered as absolute right. The requirement of restriction to be reasonable means that the High Court Division has the power to Judge the reasonableness of restrictions in question. The reasonableness demands proper balancing of the fundamental rights of the people. It is the judiciary which has to finally judge the reasonableness of restriction. The restriction can be imposed by law only not an executive order (Chintanmon Rao vs State of Madhya Pradesh AIR 1951 SC 118).

21. Under Article 36 of the Constitution freedom of movement is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to every citizen of the country which can not be abridged or denied arbitrarily on mere liking disliking without any specific law authorizing lawful justification for this purpose. The reasonableness is to be determined by an objective standard and not subjective one.

22. The extent to which this right would be exercised may be limited by the law promulgated by the legislatures. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on such freedom in the public interest and the said law can be made by virtue of any entry with respect whereof parliament has power to make a law. The right to freedom of movement includes the right to move freely within a country for those who are lawfully within the country. The right to leave any country and the right to enter a country of which he is a citizen such right may be restricted in certain circumstances. Considering the need to maintain a balance between the freedom of the individual and the general welfare of the community, reasonable restrictions may be imposed on the enjoyment of the right by or under the authority of law. Indian Supreme Court in the case of Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India reported in AIR 1978 (SC) 597 held, by majority, that it must be "right and just and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive; otherwise, it should be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied." By a law a reasonable restriction may be put on the movement of a citizen or he may even be externed from one place of the country, but he can not be externed from the country. In the case of Razendrum vs RK Mishra reported in (2010) 1 SSC page 457 it was observed that detention by Airport intelligence authorities of an air passenger travelling with huge amount of cash is not violative of the freedom of movement as the right of any person to carry money is subject to verification or seizure by intelligence authority to ensure that the said money is not intended for illegal activities. The possession and enjoyment of all rights, as was observed by the Supreme Court of America in Jacobson vs Massachusetts, (1904)197 US 643 are subject to such reasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing authority of the country essential to the safety, health, peace, general order and morals of the community.

23. In the case of MH Devendrappa vs The Karnataka SSI Corporation reported in AIR 1998 SC 1064; i was observed that fundamental freedom are not necessarily mutually supportive; some restrictions on one right may be necessary to protect other rights in a given situation and proper exercise of rights may have, implicit in them; certain restrictions. For this the rights must be harmoniously construed so that they are properly promoted with the minimum of such implied and necessary restrictions.

24. The provision provided in Article 36 safeguard the right to go abroad against executive interference which is not supported by law; and law here means ‘inacted law.' No person can be deprived of his right to go abroad unless there is a law made by the State for so depriving him and the deprivation is effected strictly in accordance with law. In the exercise of his rights and freedom, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law. In an organized society, there can be no absolute liberty without social control. Liberty is not unbridled licence. Some restrictions on freedom of movement are legitimate if imposed for limited purposes in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. Limitations on the freedom is justified but the limits must generally be reasonable, prescribed by law, and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. It was what Edmund Burke called ‘regulated Freedom'. Freedoms if absolute would always, be detrimental to the smooth functioning of the, society as the individual interests of all individuals would be priorised. The State can truncate the enjoyment of the freedoms through law. The protection of the collective is the bone marrow and that is why liberty in a civilized society, cannot be absolute. There cannot be any such thing as absolute or uncontrolled liberty wholly freed from restraint, for that would lead to anarchy and disorder. The language of Article 36, clearly indicates that the protection it secures is limited one. In no case may a person be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his or her own country, and that there are few, if any, circumstances in which deprivation of the right to enter a person's own country could be considered reasonable. Legislation which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed and the general welfare.

25. With the discussion made above, it is observed:—

The fundamental right guaranteed under Article 36 of the Constitution is non-absolute right. The right to leave one's country has therefore never been considered an absolute right. The right may be restricted in certain circumstances.
Article 36 of the Constitution permits imposition of restrictions. However, such restrictions must be by way of the law enacted and must be reasonably needed in the public interest.

Without backing of law imposition of restriction on the freedom of movement by an executive order will be unconstitutional.
The legislative view of what constitute reasonable restriction shall not be conclusive and final and that it shall be subjected to supervision by the Court.

B. A. restriction in order to be referred to as reasonable shall not be arbitrary and shall not be beyond what is required in the interest of the public. The restriction imposed shall have a direct or proximate nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the law.

Freedoms if absolute would always be detrimental to smooth functioning of the society. Reasonableness demands proper balancing.

The right to leave the country and to possess a passport may be restricted, most notably if the person's presence is required due to their having been charged with a criminal offence. However, merely because a person is involved in a criminal case, he is not denude of his fundamental rights.

Restriction may be imposed on travel in order to prevent exit from the country by persons who leave quickly to avoid due process of law. However, this would be subject to confirmation by the appropriate Court within a period of 3 working days.
With the observations made above, all the petitions are disposed of.

JUDGMENT
Obaidul Hassan, J.

1. All these Civil Appeals are being disposed of by this common judgment as all of those involve common questions of law and facts as well as all appeals have arisen out of a common judgment.

2. These Civil Appeals by leave granting order dated 12.12.2010 by this Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeals No. 1302-1305 of 2010 at the instance of the appellant has been directed against the judgment and order dated 12.04.2010 passed by the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka in Administrative Appellate Tribunal Appeals No. 134, 139, 143 and 144 of 2009 allowing the appeals reversing the judgment and order dated 23.03.2009 passed by the Administrative Tribunal No. 1, Dhaka in Administrative Tribunal Case Nos. 166 of 2007 and 22 of 2008, disallowing the case.

3. The facts leading to the filing of these Civil Appeals in short are that, there was a public advertisement for recruitment of Upazilla/Thana Election Officer in the scale of Tk. 4300-7740/- published in the Daily Ittefaq on 23.09.2003, in response to which the respondents having the requisite qualifications aspiring to get appointment applied for the post. Later on being successful to pass in both the written and viva voce examinations 328 candidates including the respondents finally selected for appointment with a direction to join the said posts by 7th September, 2005. Applicants in serial Nos. 8,16,26,39,40,68 and 69 to the Administrative Tribunal Case No. 166 of 2007 joined on 29.12.2005 and 06.12.2006 while the rest of all joined on 07.09.2005. On being posted at different Upazillas/Thanas as Election Officers the respondents joined the respective posting places as per direction of the Election Commission and all of them had been discharging their duties with sincerity and honesty. According to the notification being No election commissioner/pra-1/1-0;/Tha:/Ni:-5/2005 533 dated 4th September, 2005 it was stipulated that the respondents would be on probation for two years subject to extension or curtailment by the authority. It was further stipulated that the probation officer would be provided with four months Foundation Training in BPATC or any other institution and the government may provide further training before or after the Foundation Training. In addition to Foundation Training the respondents would be given other training for professional skill and special skill as Election Officer. Due to rush of work for holding election in early 2006, the respondents were not given Foundation Training to impart basic understanding of working in a government office. The respondents, however, given two courses of training each of having three days duration, one on preparation of voter lists and the other on core training courses and on completion of training they were awarded Certificate of Achievement. The respondents had been discharging their duties to the satisfaction of the authority. There was neither any complaint nor any allegation that they were not doing their job properly. For their satisfactory performance many of the respondents were given the enhanced assignment of District Election Officer. The applicants No. 7 and 39 were given additional charge of District Election Officer, Bandarban and Nilphamari respectively. There was serious political agitation against the functioning of Election Commission under the then Chief Election Commissioner, Mr. Justice Aziz. The parliamentary election was scheduled for 22nd January, 2007 which was abandoned later. When State emergency was declared a new Caretaker Government took up the power and the Election Commission was thoroughly reconstituted. There was rampant allegation in the media that many Election Officers appointed in September, 2005 were selected with the grace of the leader of Jote-Sarker. The applicants had no political affiliation rather were selected on the basis of competitive examination held by the Bangladesh Public Service Commission. The reconstituted Election Commission being obliged to work objectively and independently above any political affiliation, took a noble initiative to weed out the appointees got appointment through political affiliation. But instead of verifying the political background of Upazilla/Thana Election Officers through members of intelligent service of the Government, the Election Commission committed wrong in entrusting the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), University of Dhaka to determine the fitness of the Election Officer. The test held by the IBA is neither authorized by law nor had the institute any such skill or resource to verify the political background of the Election Officers. Despite the said reason the applicants were notified to attend at a fitness test by the IBA and the allocation of marks was 20% on general knowledge; 10% on general math; 30% on language and 40% on election Rules and Regulations. The aforesaid allocation of marks had nothing to do with the performance of the applicants as probationary Election Officers. The test on the MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions) method was held on 18th May, 2007. The question paper was in English and the time allotted was only two hours. For most of the applicants the method was unknown and incomprehensible. However, all the applicants had excellent performance on election related laws, but they could not do well on language and communications. The said test had no real basis nor had any nexus with the political background of the applicants. Moreover, the IBA had neither access to Annual Confidential Reports (ACR) of the applicants nor had any scope to consult the superior officers of the applicants for their field works. Although the applicants came out successful in the fitness insofar as it relates to election laws and regulations, the Election Commission by its notification dated 03.09.2007 terminated the applicants-respondents from their service on false allegations that their performance during probation period was not satisfactory.

4. Being aggrieved the respondents served a notice of Demand for Justice to the Election Commission on 06.09.2007 and thereafter the order being passed by order of the President and having no appellate authority against the impugned order the petitioners-respondents filed the above applications before the Administrative Tribunal No. 1, Dhaka.

5. The opposite parties-appellants contested both the cases by filing separate written statements contending inter alia that the test of competency is confidential and the test of competency of the respondents was rightly tested on English Language, General Mathematics, Election Laws and Regulations. The respondents having failed in the competency test to meet the requirement for confirmation during two years' probation period. The Election Commission was legally authorized to test the competency of the respondents in the manner it prescribed.

6. Upon hearing all the parties both the cases were dismissed by the judgment and order dated 23.03.2009. Being aggrieved with judgment and order dated 23.03.2009 the petitioners-appellants-respondents preferred Appeals No. 134 of 2009, 139 of 2009, 143 of 2009 and 144 of 2009 before the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka. On conclusion of hearing both sides the Administrative Appellate Tribunal allowed the appeals setting aside the termination order of the respondents from service and also directed to reinstate them in their service with arrear salary and other benefits by the impugned judgment and order dated 12.04.2010.

7. Feeling aggrieved with the judgment and order dated 12.04.2010 passed by the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka in Administrative Appellate Tribunal Appeals No. 134, 139, 143 and 144 of 2009 the appellant filed the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeals No. 1302-1305 of 2010 before this Division. After hearing the parties this Division was pleased to grant leave by order dated 12.12.2010 and hence these Civil Appeals.

8. Leave was granted to consider two points such as:

Whether the Administrative Appellate Tribunal was justified in not holding that all the Upazila Election Officers including the respondents having participated in the test conducted by the Institute of Business Administration, Dhaka University without any objection or protest and the respondents being unsuccessful in the test;
Whether the Administrative Appellate Tribunal was justified in not holding that the respondents have joined in their service on 7th September, 2009 and there being a provision empowering the Election Commission terminating service of those employees if they are found lacking in efficiency and their service having been terminated on 3rd September, 2007 i.e. before completion of 2 (two) years, the Election Commission committed no illegality in terminating service of the Respondents;
Whether the Administrative Appellate Tribunal was justified in not holding the efficiency, neutrality and impartiality of the Election Officers being necessary for holding a democratic and impartial election and allegations having been made against the respondents that they have allegiance to a certain political party and no denial having been made to the said allegations.
9. Mr. A.M. Amin Uddin, the learned Attorney General took the lead while producing his submissions on behalf of the appellant. Mr. Sk. Mohd. Murshid, the learned Additional Attorney General and Mr. Mehedi Hassan Chowdhury, the learned Additional Attorney General adopted the submissions produced by the learned Attorney General. The submissions on behalf of the learned Counsels for the appellant are shortly stated in the following. The learned Counsels on behalf of the appellant assailing the impugned judgment and order of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal submitted that the Administrative Appellate Tribunal committed illegality in not holding that the termination order of the respondents was termination simpliciter not stigmatic. To established their submissions they relied on several decisions of the Indian Supreme Court in Mathew P. Thomas Vs. Kerala State Civil Supply Corporation Ltd. (2003) 3 SCC 263; Progressive Education Society Vs. Rajendra (2008) 3 SCC 310; Chaitanya Prakash Vs. H. Omkarappa (2010) 2 SCC 623 and also a decision of this Division in the Federation of Pakistan Vs. Mrs. A.V. Issacs 9 DLR (1957) SC 16.

10. Per contra, Mr. Probir Neogi, the learned senior Advocate, Mr. Obaidur Rahman Mostafa, the learned Advocate, Mr. Qumrul Haque Siddique, the learned senior Advocate, Mr. Salahuddin Dolan, the learned senior Advocate and Mr. A.F. Hassan Ariff, the learned senior Advocate made their submissions on behalf of the respective respondents. All the learned aforesaid Counsels for the respondents except Mr. obaidur Rahman Mostafa at one echo vehemently contended that the respondents had been terminated during the probation period maliciously and their termination order was not termination simpliciter rather stigmatic or punitive and as such said termination order was illegal and liable to be set aside. Supporting the judgment and order of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal the learned Counsel for the respondents next contended that the Administrative Appellate Tribunal was correct to set aside the said termination order. In support of their submissions the learned Counsels for the respondents put reliance on a decision of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Ajit Singh Vs. State of Punjab AIR 1983 SC 494. The discussion of the said decision will be made at the later part of this judgment.

11. We have considered the submissions of the learned advocates for the both sides, perused the judgment and order dated 12.04.2010 passed by the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka in Appeals No. 134, 139, 143 and 144 of 2009 and the judgment and order dated 23.03.2009 passed by the Administrative Tribunal No. 1, Dhaka in Administrative Tribunal Case Nos. 166 of 2007 and 22 of 2008 and the materials on record.

12. It is on the record that an advertisement for the appointment in the post of Upazila/Thana Election Officers under the Election Commission Secretariat was published by Bangladesh Public Service Commission (shortly, BPSC) asking applications from the qualified candidates having either 1st class Masters degree or 1st class Masters degree along with 2nd class Honours degree. After holding both written and viva voce examinations as many as 328 candidates including the respondents were finally selected for the appointment in the said posts advertised for, by the BPSC. Accordingly the Election Commission appointed them by Gazette Notification dated 4th September, 2005 and subsequently upon their joining to the aforesaid posts their joining letters were accepted by the Election Commission through Gazette Notification dated 8th September, 2005. The respondents were appointed in the posts under certain terms and conditions. The relevant portion of their appointment notification is extracted below:

13. From the above it emanates that the respondents were appointed in the aforesaid posts with condition of undergoing probation period for two years and their appointment will be permanent on satisfactory completion of their probation period. It transpires from the record that during the probation period all the appointees including the respondents had been asked by the Election Commission Secretariat to sit for the suitability test held by the Institute of Business Administration, University of Dhaka. The test was held opting for MCQ method and the total marks of the test was allocated in the following way:

"General Knowledge (20%); General Math (10%); Language and Communication (30%) and Election Rules and Regulations (40%)."
14. All the appointees sat for the said test and all of them except the respondents became successful in the test. Thereafter, the Election Commission Secretariat terminated the appointment of the respondents with effect from 6th September 2007. The pertinent portion of the said notification is as follows:

“নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ের অধীনস্থ মাঠ পর্যায়ে উপজেলা/থানা নির্বাচন অফিসার পদে কর্মরত নিম্নবর্ণিত কর্মকর্তাগণের শিক্ষানবিসকালে কর্ম সম্পাদন সন্তোষজনক না হওয়ায় নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ের ২০ ভাদ্র ১৪১২ বাং/৪ সেপ্টেম্বর তারিখের নিকস/প্র-১/১-উ/থা:নি:অ:-৫/২০০৫/৫৩৩ নং প্রজ্ঞাপনের ১(গ) নং অনুচ্ছেদে বর্ণিত শর্তানুসারে তাহাদের চাকুরীতে বহাল রাখিবার অনুপযোগী বিবেচনা পূর্বক ৬-৯-২০০৭ তারিখ হইতে তাহাদের সরকারী চাকুরীর অবসান করা হইল।”
15. In view of the factual matrix of the instant case it is manifested that the respondents had been terminated from their service during the probation period. The main point of controversy between the appellants and the respondents is whether the Election Commission Secretariat committed illegality terminating the service of the respondents during the probation period.

16. The respondents being appointed in September, 2005 the provisions of the Election Commission (Officers and Staff) Rules, 1979 (in short, the Rules 1979) including its amendment made on 25th May 2005 is applicable regarding their appointment. The provision as to the period of probation of the respondents in their service as stated in the appointment notification shall be construed in conjunction with Rule 11 of the Rules 1979. In fact, the conditions of probation period stated in paragraph (Ga) of the appointment notification dated 4th September 2005 emanates its force from Rule 11 of the Rules 1979. For better understanding Rule 11 of the Rules 1979 is extracted below:

"11. Probation-(1) Persons selected for appointment to a specified post, otherwise than by transfer on deputation, against a substantive vacancy shall be on probation-
(a) in the case of direct recruitment, for a period of two years from the date of substantive appointment; and
(b) in the case of promotion, for a period of one year from the date of such appointment:
Provided that the appointing authority may, for reasons to be recorded in writing extend the period of probation by a period or periods so that the extended period does not exceed two years in the aggregate.

(2) Soon after the completion of the period of probation, including the extended period, if any, the appointing authority-
(a) if it is satisfied that the conduct and the work of the probationer during his period of probation has been satisfactory, shall confirm him; and
(b) if it is of opinion that the conduct and the work of the probationer during that period was not satisfactory, may-
(i) in the case of direct recruitment, terminate his service; and
(ii) in the case of promotion, revert him to the post from which he was promoted."
17. Thus, from the above provisions of law it is amply clear that persons selected for appointment to a specified post shall be on probation for a period of two years from the date of substantive appointment or for extended period not exceeding two years in the aggregate. Regarding the purpose of probation it has been observed very succinctly in the case of Khazia Mohammed Muzammil vs. The State of Karnataka and Ors. reported in (2010) 8 SCC 155 at paragraph No. 12 that-

"The purpose of any probation is to ensure that before the employee attains the status of confirmed regular employee, he should satisfactorily perform his duties and functions to enable the authorities to pass appropriate orders. In other words, the scheme of probation is to judge the ability, suitability and performance of an officer under probation."
18. From the above discussion it can easily be understood the object and purpose underlying the concept of probationary period. Admittedly during the probation period the respondents including the other employees numbering 328 in total had been required to sit for a suitability test held by the IBA, University of Dhaka and the respondents agreeing with the decision appeared in the examination but finally they became unsuccessful. However, all other employees succeeded in the examination. In the said backdrop the authority terminated the appointment of the respondents inasmuch as they could not pass in the suitability test during the period of probation.

19. From the bare reading of the termination notification as stated earlier it is evident that the respondents had been terminated from the service due to their dissatisfactory performance in the service during the probation period. But it is argued by the respondents that the said order was not termination simpliciter rather it was punitive for which the said termination order of the respondents was illegal. Mr. Salahuddin Dolon, the learned Counsel for the respondents contended that the respondents had been terminated during the probation period due to their appointment was made during the regime of another political government and as such the termination was not simpliciter rather punitive. To establish his submission he relied on the decision made in Ajit Singh vs. State of Punjab AIR 1983 SC 494 wherein it was held that if the government servants are terminated arbitrarily and not on the ground of unsuitability, unsatisfactory conduct or the like, the said termination is illegal.

20. At this juncture let us examine whether the termination of the Respondents from service was simpliciter or punitive. It is to be noted that the law as to the probation of an employee in our country is almost identical to that of India. The decisions of Indian Supreme Court are more categorical in this area and deals with the issue eloquently touching its every facet. More importantly, we may refer to the case of Chaitanya Prakash Vs. H. Omkarappa (2010) reported in 2 SCC 623 where it has been held by the Indian Supreme Court as under:

"It is no longer res integra that even if an order of termination refers to unsatisfactory service of the person concerned, the same cannot be said to be stigmatic. In this connection, we make a reference to the decision of the Supreme Court in Abhijit Gupta Vs. S.N.B. National Centre, Basic Sciences (2006) 4 SCC 469 wherein also a similar letter was issued to the employee concerned intimating him that his performance was unsatisfactory and, therefore, he is not suitable for confirmation. We have considered the ratio in light of the facts of the said case and we are of the considered opinion that the basic facts of the said case are almost similar to the one in hand. There also, letters were issued to the concerned employee to improve his performance in the areas of his duties and that despite such communications the service was found to be unsatisfactory. In the result, a letter was issued to him pointing out that his service was found to be unsatisfactory and that he was not suitable for confirmation, and, therefore, his probation period was not extended and his service was terminated, which was challenged on the ground that the same was stigmatic for alleged misconduct. The Supreme Court negatived the said contention and upheld the order of termination.

In Mathew P. Thomas v. Kerala State Civil Supply Corporation Ltd. (2003) 3 SCC 263 also the concerned employee was kept on probation for a period of two years. During the course of his employment he was also informed that despite being told to improve his performance time and again there is no such improvement. His shortfalls were brought to his notice and consequently by order dated 16.01.1997 his services were terminated, wherein also a reference was made to his unsatisfactory service. In the said decision, the Supreme Court has held that on the basis of long line of decisions it appears that whether an order of termination is simpliciter or punitive has ultimately to be decided having due regard to the facts and circumstances of each case.

In Pavanendra Narayan Verma v. Sanjay Gandhi PGI of Medical Sciences (2002) 1 SCC 520 this Court had the occasion to determine as to whether the impugned order therein was a letter of termination of services simpliciter or stigmatic termination. After considering various earlier decisions of this Court in paragraph 21 of the aforesaid decision it was observed by this Court as under:

"One of the judicially evolved tests to determine whether in substance an order of termination is punitive is to see whether prior to the termination there was (a) a full-scale formal enquiry (b) into allegations involving moral turpitude or misconduct which (c) culminated in a finding of guilt. If all three factors are present the termination has been held to be punitive irrespective of the form of the termination order. Conversely if any one of the three factors is missing, the termination has been upheld.

In Abhijit Gupta (Supra.), this Court considered as to what will be the real test to be applied in a situation where an employee is removed by an innocuous order of termination i.e. whether he is discharged as unsuitable or he is punished for his misconduct. In order to answer the said question, the Court relied and referred to the decision of this Court in Allahabad Bank Officers Assn. vs. Allahabad Bank (1996) 4 SCC 504 where it is stated thus:

"14............... As pointed out in this judgment, expressions like 'want of application', 'lack of potential' and 'found not dependable' when made in relation to the work of the employee would not be sufficient to attract the charge that they are stigmatic and intended to dismiss the employee from service."
21. Further it has been observed in the case of Chandra Prakash Shahi v. State of U.P. (2000) reported in 5 SCC 152 (paragraph-27) that-

"The important principles which are deducible on the concept of 'motive' and 'foundation', concerning a probationer, are that a probationer has no right to hold the post and his services can be terminated at any time during or at the end of the period of probation on account of general unsuitability for the post in question. If for the determination of suitability of the probationer for the post in question or for his further retention in service or for confirmation, an inquiry is held and it is on the basis of that inquiry that a decision is taken to terminate his service, the order will not be punitive in nature. But, if there are allegations of misconduct and an inquiry is held to find out the truth of that misconduct and an order terminating the service is passed on the basis of that inquiry, the order would be punitive in nature as the inquiry was held not for assessing the general suitability of the employee for the post in question, but to find out the truth of allegations of misconduct against that employee. In this situation, the order would be founded on misconduct and it will not be a mere matter of 'motive'.

'Motive' is the moving power which impels action for a definite result, or to put it differently, 'motive' is that which incites or stimulates a person to do an act. An order terminating the services of an employee is an act done by the employer. What is that factor which impelled the employer to take this action? If it was the factor of general unsuitability of the employee for the post held by him, the action would be upheld in law. If, however, there were allegations of serious misconduct against the employee and a preliminary inquiry is held behind his back to ascertain the truth of those allegations and a termination order is passed thereafter, the order, having regard to other circumstances, would be founded on the allegations of misconduct which were found to be true in the preliminary inquiry."
22. Having examined the aforesaid decisions of the Indian Supreme Court it is squarely evident that the employer is legally authorized to assess the competency of an employee during the period of probation. Simultaneously, the employer is entitled to terminate the service of the employee during the probation period due to unsatisfactory performance. We are also of the view that whether a termination order is simpliciter or stigmatic will be ascertained based on the factual matrix of each case. On plain reading of the termination order of the respondents it appears that the same is ex-facie not stigmatic. It simply terminates the service of the respondents as their service was found not satisfactory.

23. In the case in hand the Election Commission terminated the service of the Respondents during the probation period as they did not come out successful in a test arranged by the IBA. The said test was held to ascertain the general suitability and competence of the Respondents to remain in their service. Such test cannot be termed as 'not befitting' to examine the suitability of the employee. The said test was held through MCQ method which is a universally accepted method for suitability test. The IBA under the University of Dhaka was assigned to arrange the test. Indisputably, the IBA under the University of Dhaka is one of the top-notch educational institutions in our country and it is widely recognized for its transparency, accountability and genuineness in respect of the examination system. More so, the question pattern of the test was in commensurate with the qualifications of the respondents having either Masters degree with 1st class or 2nd class Honours with Master degree.

24. The respondents could not bring any materials on record from which it could be manifested that there was allegation of misconduct against them and an inquiry was held behind their back in pursuant to which they had been terminated from service during the probation period. Therefore, we are of the view that the Election Commission Secretariat was in right stand to arrange for a suitability test during the probation period of the respondents and on being unsuccessful in the suitability test the respondents had been terminated from service which we hold to termination simpliciter not stigmatic.

25. Again, the respondents did not challenge the decision of the Election Commission Secretariat for holding suitability test rather they accepting the decision of the Election Commission Secretariat appeared in the said test and in the said way the respondents also admitted the decision of the Election Commission Secretariat for holding the suitability test and as such they are barred by the principle of estoppel. Due to the aforesaid reason the respondents are estopped from denying that the said suitability test was not proper method of their assessment. Had the aforesaid test been unsuitable for assessing their ability during the probation period they should not have participated in the test.

26. The learned Advocate on behalf of the respondents argued that according to Rule 11 of the Rules 1979 the authority is entitled to terminate the service of a probationer during the probation period if it is found that the conduct and work of him is not satisfactory. In that case it was incumbent upon the Election Commission to assess the performance of the respondents on the basis of their ACR, integrity, efficiency, good conduct, character, sense of value and temperamental suitability, departmental training etc. The Election Commission assigned the responsibility of taking examination to the IBA, who has neither access to ACR nor has any report regarding the integrity and performance of the respondents. But the entire assessment was done on the basis of the result of an examination which was taken beyond the conditions stipulated in the appointment notification. In this regard, our considered view is that holding examination for the appointees while undergoing probation period is not restricted in law to assess their suitability in service. Rather the assessment of a probationer is not confined only to good conduct and character, but also their competency for service.

27. During hearing the learned Counsels for the respondents further contended that the Election Commission Secretariat purportedly terminated the service of the respondents resorting to pick and choose policy. It transpires from the record that all the 328 candidates sat for the suitability test in which all but the respondents did not come out successful and the Election Commission Secretariat terminated the appointment of the respondents based on the result of the suitability test. Thus, we find no substance in the aforesaid claim of the learned Counsel for the respondents.

28. The learned Counsels for the respondents also contended that the Election Commission in its plenary meeting No. 294/2010 held on 11.05.2010 perused the judgment and order of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal and decided to implement the said judgment and order by reinstating the respondents in service cancelling the notification dated 03.09.2007. Pursuant to the said decision of the Election Commission, reinstatement of the respondents in the service was notified on 13.05.2010 and the same was published in the official Gazette notification on 25.05.2010. The Election Commission also by an official letter dated 22.06.2010 communicated its decision not to prefer appeal against the judgment and order of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal to the office of the Prime Minister. But the Cabinet Secretary bypassing all the aforesaid decisions filed these Civil Appeals interfering with the independent functioning of the Election Commission as enunciated in Article 118(4) of the Constitution.

29. To address the above issue we need to have a glance at the decision of the Election Commission which is extracted below:

“প্রশাসনিক আপীল ট্রাইব্যুনালের এ.এ.টি ১০৪/২০০৯, ১৩৯/২০০৯, ১৪৩/২০০৯ ও ১৪৪/২০০৯ নং (এ. টি, কেস নং-১৬৬/২০০৭ ও ২২/২০০৮ নং হতে উদ্ভূত), মামলার রায় কমিশন সভায় গভীরভাবে পর্যালোচনা করা হয়। আপীল ট্রাইব্যুনাল তার রায়ে যথাযথ কারণ যুক্তি উল্লেখপূর্বক এ.টি মামলা নং-১৬৬/২০০৭ ও ২২/২০০৮-তে ঘোষিত রায় বাতিল করেন। আপীল ট্রাইব্যুনালের রায়ের বিরুদ্ধে সুপ্রীম কোর্টের আপীল বিভাগে আপীল দায়ের করার মত শক্তিশালী উপাদান নেই। এমতাবস্থায় প্রশাসনিক আপীল ট্রাইব্যুনালের রায়ের আলোকে নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ের ৩ সেপ্টেম্বর ২০০৭ তারিখের নিকস/উ: স: (এ-২)/২০০৭/সেপ্টেম্বর-নিয়োগ/১৩৯ সংখ্যক প্রজ্ঞাপন বাতিল পূর্বক অবসানকৃত ৮৫ জন উপজেলা/থানা নির্বাচন কর্মকর্তাকে পুনর্বহালের সিদ্ধান্ত নেয়া যায়। রায় অনুযায়ী ৮৫ জন উপজেলা/থানা নির্বাচন কর্মকর্তা (পরিশিষ্ট-'খ' অনুযায়ী) বেতন-ভাতাদিসহ অন্যান্য সুযোগ-সুবিধাদি প্রাপ্য হবেন। তাদের দ্রুত পদায়ন ও সংক্ষিপ্ত প্রশিক্ষণের প্রয়োজনীয় কার্যক্রম গ্রহণ করা যেতে পারে।

২.৪ সিদ্ধান্ত: বিস্তারিত আলোচনার পর কমিশন নিম্নরুপ সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহণ করেন।
(ক) প্রশাসনিক আপীল ট্রাইব্যুনালের রায় পর্যালোচনায় সুপ্রীম কোর্টের আপীল বিভাগে আপীল করার মত প্রয়োজনীয় গ্রাউন্ড নেই।
(খ) রায়ের আলোকে নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ের ৩ সেপ্টেম্বর, ২০০৭ তারিখের নিকস/ভি:স(প্র-২)/২০০৭ সেপ্টেম্বর-নিয়োগ/১৩৯ নং প্রজ্ঞাপন বাতিল পূর্বক ৮৫ জন উপজেলা/থানা নির্বাচন কর্মকর্তাকে দ্রুত পদায়ন ও সংক্ষিপ্ত প্রশিক্ষণের প্রয়োজনীয় কার্যক্রম গ্রহণ করতে হবে।
(গ) রায় অনুযায়ী ৮৫ জন উপজেলা/থানা নির্বাচন কর্মকর্তা (পরিশিষ্ট-“খ” অনুযায়ী) বকেয়া বেতন-ভাতাদিসহ অন্যান্য সুযোগ-সুবিধাদি প্রাপ্য হবেন।”
30. But on perusal of the record it reveals that subsequently the Election Commission decided to contest the present appeals. The decision of the Election Commission is stated below:

“উপজেলা/থানা নির্বাচন অফিসার পদে চাকুরি অবসানকৃত ৮৫ জন কর্মকর্তার মামলার বিষয়ে প্রতিদ্বন্দিতা না করার জন্য বিগত নির্বাচন কমিশনের ১১-৫-২০১০ তারিখের ২৯৪/২০১০তম কমিশন সভার সিদ্ধান্ত হয়। সেই সময়ের প্রেক্ষাপট আর বর্তমান প্রেক্ষাপট সম্পূর্ণ ভিন্ন বলে মাননীয় নির্বাচন কমিশনারগণ মনে করেন। বর্তমান প্রেক্ষাপটে উল্লিখিত মামলায় নির্বাচন কমিশনের পক্ষ হয়ে প্রতিদ্বন্দিতা করার সিদ্ধান্ত যৌক্তিক বলে মাননীয় নির্বাচন কমিশনারগণ মতামত ব্যক্ত করেন।”
31. From the above it is transparent that the Election Commission reverted from their earlier decision of not contesting appeal and now it is contesting the appeal pursuant to its own decision, thereby there is no question of interference with the functions of the Election Commission.

32. The learned Counsels on behalf of the respondents referring to the provisions of Articles 118(4), 120 of the Constitution of Bangladesh, Sections 3 and 5 of the Election Commission Secretariat Act, 2009 argued that the respondents being the employees of the Election Commission only the Election Commission has the exclusive control and authority over them and the Election Commission is empowered to take decision in respect of their reinstatement in service but the Cabinet Secretary being the part of Executive Organ of the Government had no locus standi to file the Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal leading to the present appeals against the judgment and order of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal. In this regard let us examine the provisions of law.

33. Article 118(4) of the Constitution enunciates that-

"The Election Commission shall be independent in the exercise of its functions and subject only to this Constitution and any other law"
34. Article 119 of the Constitution lays down the functions of the Election Commission which is as follows-

"119.(1) The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of the electoral rolls for elections to the office of President and to Parliament and the conduct of such elections shall vest in the Election Commission which shall, in accordance with this Constitution and any other law-
(a) hold elections to the office of President;
(b) hold elections of members of Parliament;
(c) delimit the constituencies for the purpose of elections to Parliament; and
(d) prepare electoral rolls for the purpose of elections to the office of President and to Parliament."
(2) The Election Commission shall perform such functions, in addition to those specified in the foregoing clauses, as may be prescribed by this Constitution or by any other law."
35. Article 120 of the Constitution provides that-

"The President shall, when so requested by the Election Commission, make available to it such staff as may be necessary for the discharge of its functions under this part."
36. Article 126 of the Constitution lays down that-

"It shall be the duty of all executive authorities to assist the Election Commission in the discharge of its functions."
37. From examination of the aforesaid provisions of the Constitution the cumulative effect is that the Election Commission is independent while exercising its power under Article 119 of the Constitution which does not include the power of appointment and terms and conditions of service of the employee under the Election Commission Secretariat. According to Article 119 during the election all Deputy Commissioners, Superintendents of Police and other concerned officials are placed under the control of the Election Commission for the purpose of holding election. Undoubtedly, none of the organs of the Government including the executive can interfere with the functions of the Election Commission. It is also apparent from the record that the Cabinet Secretary did not challenge the decision of the Election Commission rather he preferred the present Appeals against the judgment and order of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal involving the termination of the respondent from service. Thus, no question arises as to the interference with the functions of the Election Commission.

38. Now let us see what are the legal provisions regarding the appointment and service of the employees of the Election Commission. The Election Commission (Officers and Staff) Rules, 1979 were applicable to the respondents at the relevant period of their appointment.

39. Section 2(a) of Rules 1979 provides that--

"(a) "Appointing Authority" means such authority as has been specified in column 6 of Schedule IV;"
40. Section 8(1) of the Rules 1979 says that-

"appointment to a direct recruitment shall not be made except upon the recommendation of the Bangladesh Public Service Commission:"
41. Again, Section 3 of নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয় আইন, ২০০৯ states that-

“৩। নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয় ।__(১) নির্বাচন কমিশনের একটি নিজস্ব সচিবালয় থাকিবে এবং উহা নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয় নামে অভিহিত হইবে।
(২) নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয় সরকারের কোন মন্ত্রণালয়, বিভাগ বা দপ্তরের প্রশাসনিক আওতাধীন থাকিবে না।
(৩) নির্বাচন কমিশনের পক্ষে আইন প্রণয়ন সম্পর্কিত বিষয়াদি আইন, বিচার ও সংসদ বিষয়ক মন্ত্রণালয় কর্তৃক সম্পাদিত হইবে।
(৪) নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয় বিধি দ্বারা নির্ধারিত পদ্ধতিতে নিযুক্ত একজন সচিব এবং অন্যান্য কর্মকর্তা ও কর্মচারীগণের সমন্বয়ে গঠিত হইবে ।”
42. Section 5 of নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয় আইন, 2009 provides that—

“৫ । নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ের নিয়ন্ত্রণ ।__
(১) নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ের সার্বিক নিয়ন্ত্রণ প্রধান নির্বাচন কমিশনারের উপর ন্যস্ত থাকিবে এবং সচিব নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ের প্রশাসনিক প্রধান হইবেন।
(২) সচিব নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ের প্রশাসন, শৃঙ্খলা বিধান এবং সচিবালয়ের উপর অর্পিত কার্যাদি যথাযথভাবে সম্পাদন করিবেন । তিনি এই আইন এবং তদধীন প্রণীত বিধিমালার অধীন বিধানাবলীর যথাযথ প্রতিপালন নিশ্চিত করিবেন এবং প্রধান নির্বাচন সময়ে অবহিত করিবেন।
(৩) প্রধান নির্বাচন কমিশনার নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ের দায়িত্ব বিধি বা স্থায়ী আদেশ দ্বারা নির্ধারিত পদ্ধতিতে অন্য কোন কমিশনার কিংবা নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ের কোন কর্মকর্তাকে অর্পণ করিতে পারিবেন ।”
43. Rule 2 of নির্বাচন কমিশন (কর্মকর্তা ও কর্মচারী) নিয়োগ বিধিমালা, 2008 states that-

“(গ) নিয়োগকারী কর্তৃপক্ষ অর্থ সরকার বা সরকার কর্তৃক ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত যে কোন কর্মকর্তা;”
44. Rule 11 of নির্বাচন কমিশন (কর্মকর্তা ও কর্মচারী) নিয়োগ বিধিমালা, ২০০৮--

“কর্মকর্তা ও কর্মচারীগণের চাকুরীর সাধারণ শর্তাবলী__
এই আইনের বিধানাবলী সাপেক্ষে, প্রজাতন্ত্রের অসামরিক পদে নিযুক্ত সরকারী কর্মকর্তা ও কর্মচারীগণের ক্ষেত্রে প্রযোজ্য চাকুরীর শর্তাবলী নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়ে নিযুক্ত সকল কর্মকর্তা ও কর্মচারীগণের ক্ষেত্রে প্রযোজ্য হইবে ।”
45. On scrutiny of the aforesaid provisions of law we arrive at a decision that the employees of the Election Commission Secretariat are appointed by the government and the terms and conditions of government employees are equally applicable in respect of the employees of the Election Commission. We find that both Sections 3 and 5 of talk about the independence of Election Commission Secretariat while Rules 2 and 11 of categorically states about the appointment of the employees and their terms and conditions in service. Virtually, Sections 3 and 5 of the do not put any embargo on the applicability of the contemporary government service laws to the employees of the Election Commission Secretariat. Therefore, we are constrained to hold that the Cabinet Secretary on behalf of the Government has locus standi to file the present Appeals against the judgment and order of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal since it involves the issue of termination of service of the employee of Election Commission Secretariat. Moreover, it is seen from the record that the Cabinet Secretary was a party to the Administrative Tribunal cases.

46. In view of the elaborate discussion and the observations made above, we find merit in the submissions of the learned Counsels for the Appellant and therefore the impugned judgment and order dated 12.04.2010 passed by the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka warrants interference.

47. Accordingly, all the appeals are allowed.

48. The judgment and order dated 12.04.2010 passed by the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka in Appeals No. 134, 139, 143 and 144 of 2009 are hereby set aside.

4. Facts relevant for disposal of Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 3013 of 2019 in short are as follows:

That present respondent Nos. 1 to 4 as writ petitioners filed Writ Petition No. 17372 of 2017 stating inter alia that they were appointed with required qualifications as Lecturers in Bir Shreshtha Nur Mohammad Degree College at different times when the said College was non-government College; writ-petitioner No. 1, having qualification of BA (Hon's) and MSS (Social Science), joined as Lecturer on 25-11-1997 and since then has been serving as Lecturer of Economics in the said College; writ-petitioner No. 2, having educational qualifications of BA and MSS (Social Science), joined as Lecturer on 9-12-2002 and since then has been serving as Lecturer of Social Work; writ-petitioner No. 3, having educational qualifications of B.Com and M.Com, joined as Lecturer on 27-10-2002 and since then has been serving as Lecturer of Management; Writ-petitioner No. 4, having educational qualifications of BSS and MSS, joined as Lecturer on 10-6-2001 and since then has been serving as Lecturer of Political Science. It is stated by the writ-petitioners that two of the writ-petitioners have been enlisted as MPO teachers of the said College. Thereafter, because of good performance of the said College, the Government, vide Memo dated 21-5-2013, nationalized the said College and, accordingly, published gazette on 23-5-2013. Accordingly, the said College was renamed as Government Bir Sreshtha Nur Mohammad Degree College. Thereafter, the Ministry of Public Administration created 40 posts of teachers and some post of non-teaching staffs ignoring the recommendation of the Education Ministry to create 65 posts in total. Upon such nationalization, the Ministry of Education subsequently, on 29-5-2014, published the names of the teachers who were appointed on ad-hoc basis as per Rules 3 and 5 of the “জাতীয়করণকৃত কলেজ শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০০০”. However in the said list, the names of the writ-petitioners were not included. It is further stated that since, at the relevant time under the said “আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০০০”, the educational requirement for such absorption as Government teachers was the equivalent requirements applicable to the Government cadre posts, the writ-petitioners subsequently obtained such qualifications with prior approval from the College authority. Accordingly, a representation was made to the College authority for absorbing their service as Government teachers. Representation was made to the Director-General, Secondary and Higher Secondary Education as well for absorbing their services as Government teachers, but got no positive response. Under such circumstances writ petitioner respondent Nos. 1 to 4 have filed the writ petition and obtained the Rule Nisi.

5. Fact of Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.3045 of 2019 in short are as follows:

That respondent Nos.1 to 6 as writ petitioners have filed Writ Petition No.16602 of 2017 stating inter alia that they were appointed as Lecturers of Charfasson College with required qualifications applicable at the time of appointment. Writ-petitioner No.1, having BA and MA in Islamic Studies, was appointed as a Lecturer in Secretarial Education on 20-11-2002 and he joined on 21-11-2002. Thereafter, he was appointed as Lecturer of Islamic Studies, and since then he has been serving in the said College as Lecturer of Islamic Studies. Writ-petitioner No.2, having educational qualifications of B.Com (Honors) and M.Com (Accounting), was appointed as Lecturer in Accounting on 9-6-2012 and, accordingly, he joined in the said post on 12-6-2012. Since then he has been serving in the said College as such. Writ-petitioner No.3 was appointed as Lecturer of Philosophy on 22-2-2000 and he joined in the said post on 1-3-2000. Since then he has been serving as Lecturer of the said College. Writ-petitioner No.4, having BA and MA (Social Science), was appointed as Lecturer of Social Welfare on 8-5-2004 and she joined in the said post on 9-5-2004. Since then she has been serving as Lecturer of the said College. Writ-petitioner No.5, having B.Com and M.Com (Management), was appointed as Lecturer of Management on 9-6-2012 and joined in the said post on 12-6-2012. Since then she has been serving as such in the said College. Writ-petitioner No.6, having B.Com and Masters of Business Studies (Management), was appointed as Lecturer of Management on 9-6-2012 and he joined in the said post on 12-6-2012. Since then he has been serving as Lecturer in the said College. It is stated that because of the good, performances of the writ-petitioners, they were enlisted as MPO teachers of the said College. Thereafter, because of good performance of the said College, the Government, vide Memo dated 22-10-2013, nationalized the said College and, accordingly, published gazette on 31-10-2013. Accordingly, the said College was renamed as Charfasson Government College. Thereafter. Upon such nationalization, the Ministry of Education subsequently, on 16-4-2015, published name of the teachers who were appointed on ad-hoc basis as per Rules 3 and 5 of the “জাতীয়করণকৃত কলেজ শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০০০” and gazette notification was published on 14-5-2015 by dropping the names of the writ-petitioners in the said list. It is further stated that since, at the relevant time under the said “আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০০০”, the educational requirement for such absorption as Government teachers was the equivalent requirements applicable to the Government cadre posts, the writ-petitioners subsequently obtained such qualifications with prior approval from the Colleges authority., Accordingly, a representation was made to the College authority for absorbing their services as Government teachers. Representation was made to the Director General, Secondary and Higher Secondary Education as well for absorbing their services as Government teachers, but got no positive response. Under such circumstances writ petitioner respondent Nos. l to 6 have filed the writ petition and obtained the Rule Nisi.

6. The High Court Division took both the Rules Nisi together for hearing and ultimately, after hearing the parties and considering the materials on record, both the Rules Nisi were made absolute by the impugned judgment and order dated 29-4-2019. Hence, the writ-respondents are now before us having filed these two civil petitions for leave to appeal for redress.

7. Ms Abanti Nurul, learned Assistant Attorney-General appeared on behalf of the leave-petitioners in both the civil petitions for leave to appeal submits that the High Court Division erred in law in travelling beyond the scope of Rule Nisi in giving relief to the writ petitioner respondents under the absorption Rules, 2018 although no Rule Nisi was issued to that effect and, as such, the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set-aside. Moreover, she next submits that since the writ-petitioner respondents were appointed as Lecturer in Bir Sreshtha Nur Mohammad Degree College, Sarsha, Jessore and Charfasson Government College, Bhola, when they were the non-government Colleges in 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2012 respectively. But the said Colleges were nationalized by the Government vide gazette notification dated 14-5-2013 and 22-10-2013 and subsequently, the Ministry of Education by circular dated 15-7-2013, 22-10-2013. 29-5-2014 and 16-4-2015 published the names of the Lecturers who were appointed on ad-hoc basis on different subject for the Bir Sreshtha Nur Mohammad Degree College, Sarsha, Jessore and Charfassion College as per Rules 3 and 5 of the " জাতীয়করণকৃত কলেজ শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০০০ " and accordingly, Gazette Notification was published on 5-6-2014 and 14-5-2015 excluding the names of the writ petitioner respondents since at that point of time they had no requisite qualifications for becoming absorbed in the nationalized Colleges and, as such, the impugned judgment is liable to be set-aside. She further submitted that as per Rules 1 in Clause (2) of the “জাতীয়করণকৃত কলেজ শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০১৮” that " এই বিধিমালা জারির তারিখ বা তৎপরবর্তীতে সরকারিকৃত কলেজের ক্ষেত্রে এই বিধিমালা প্রযোজ্য হইবে।” the writ-petitioner respondents cannot claim any benefits for absorption in the nationalized Colleges under that provision of Rules and, as such, the High Court Division, without applying judicial mind, passed the judgment and order dated 29-4-2019 in clear violation of the provision of law. She lastly submitted that at the time of nationalization and post creation, the writ-petitioner respondents had no requisite qualifications and, as such, they have no right to get any remedy in the writ petition and thus impugned judgment and order is liable to be set-aside on disposing of the civil petitions. However, she submits that since some of the writ petitioners are already enjoying the Government portion of monthly salary (MPO) and other benefits they will be continuing to get the same in accordance with law.

8. Mr Md Imam Hasan, learned Advocate appeared on behalf of respondent in both the civil petitions for leave to appeal made submissions in support of the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division. He submitted that although the writ-petitioners did not have the required qualification for being absorbed as Lecturers under the Nationalized Colleges as per the provision of the " জাতীয়করণকৃত কলেজ শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০০০ " but they subsequently obtained their educational qualifications and, as such, the writ-petitioners are entitled to have their service absorbed under the Nationalized Colleges in view of " জাতীয়করণকৃত কলেজ শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০১৮" by which the earlier Rules of 2000 has been repealed as evident from the saving clause of rule 15 sub-rule 2 Kha which provides that if any teacher or staffs of the concerned College was not absorbable under the bidhimala 2000 and if their services are absorbable under the Bidhimala, 2018 then they may be absorbed under the bidhimala 2018 considering which the High Court Division has rightly passed the impugned judgment and order in accordance with law and hence he submitted that these two civil petitions for leave to appeal are liable to be dismissed by affirming the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.

9. We have considered the submissions of the learned Assistant Attorney-General for the leave-petitioners in both the civil petitions and the learned Advocate for the writ petitioner-respondents, perused the impugned judgment and order along with other connected papers on record.

10. It is not disputed that the writ-petitioners had lack of qualification for being absorbed as Lecturers under the aforesaid Nationalized Colleges as per the provision of " জাতীয়করণকৃত কলেজ শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০০০ ". The writ-petitioner respondents have stated in the additional paper book that subsequently they have upgraded their educational qualifications and, as such, they claimed that they are eligible to be absorbed as teachers in the Nationalized Colleges as per the provision of " জাতীয়করণকৃত কলেজ শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০১৮ ". In support of their claim, the learned Advocate for the writ-petitioner respondents referred to rule 15(2)(Kha) of aforesaid Absorption Bidhimala, 2018 basing on which the High Court Division has delivered the impugned judgment and order in favour of the writ petitioner-respondents and, as such, according to the learned Advocate for the writ petitioner respondents the High Court Division did riot commit any illegality in passing the impugned judgment and order.

11. In this respect, the learned Advocate for the leave-petitioners emphatically raised a question that the High Court Division has travelled beyond the scope/terms of the Rule Nisi in giving relief to the writ petitioner respondents by the impugned judgment and order which is liable to be set-aside in accordance with law.

12. To answer on this point, let us go through the prayers formulated in the writ petitions which read as follows:

"A Rule Nisi calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the refusal of the respondents in absorbing the service of the petitioners Lecturer of Government Bir Shreshtha Nur Mohammad Degree College and Charfasson Government College, Bhola upon considering the required academic qualifications of the petitioners to be absorbed as Lecturer of Government College while Nationalization of the same should not be declared to have been done without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and also to show cause as to why the respondents should not be directed to absorb the service of the petitioners as the Lecturer of Government Bir Shreshtha Nur Mohammad Degree College, Sharsha, Jessore and Charfasson Government College, Bhola upon considering the required academic qualification of the petitioners to be absorbed in the Government College while Nationalization of the same."
13. Now let us see the terms of the Rule Nisi issuing orders in both the writ petitions as appears from the impugned judgment and order which read as under:

"Rules in the aforesaid writ petitions were issuing in similar terms, namely calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why their refusal in absorbing the serviced of the petitioners as Lecturers of Government Colleges, namely Government Bir Shreshtha Nur Mohammad Degree College (Writ Petition No. 17372 of 2017) and Charfasson Government College (Writ Petition No. 16602 of 2017) after nationalization of the same upon considering the required academic qualifications of the petitioners, should not be declared to be without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and as to why they should not be directed to absorb the petitioners services as Lecturers of the said Colleges upon considering their such academic qualifications."
14. On perusal of the prayers made in the writ petitions as well as the terms of the Rule issued as per prayers as quoted above, we do not find that the writ petitioners have challenged the absorption Rules, 2000 or asked for any relief under the absorption Rules, 2018 by which the earlier absorption Rules of 2000 were repealed nor the Rule Nisi has been issued in that terms. So, the terms of the Rules Nisi in both the writ petitions are crystal clear, that the writ petitioners did not challenge the absorption Rules, 2000 or ask for any relief under the absorption Rules, 2018 by which the earlier absorption Rules of 2000 were repealed.

15. Having gone through the impugned judgment and order it appears that the High Court Division has relied on the absorption Rules of 2000 and 2018 in giving relief to the writ petitioner respondents. The High Court Division found that under the previous absorption Rules of 2000, the writ petitioners were not qualified to be absorbed as Government teachers as the minimum qualification for such absorption was the qualification applicable to a cadre post as provided in Rule 2(Chha) of the Absorption Rules of 2000. But, the new Absorption Rules of 2018 have obliterated the said requirement by Rule 5 which provides that the required qualification for absorption shall be the required qualifications for appointments in a non-government College. Therefore, the High Court Division came to a definite finding that there should not be any dispute as regards basic qualifications of the petitioners for absorption in the Government Colleges after promulgation of the new absorption Rules of 2018, which has recognized such entitlement of the petitioners for such absorption with the required qualifications for appointment in the non-government Colleges as well. So, it is clear that the High Court Division relying on the aforesaid absorption Rules of 2018 has passed the impugned judgment and order and gave relief to the writ petitioner respondents although the Rule Nisi has not been issued in that terms.

16. So, the High Court Division has travelled beyond the terms of the Rule Nisi issuing orders in both the writ petitions in giving relief to the writ petitioners by the judgment and order impugned in both the civil petitions for leave to appeal before this Division.

17. The relief under Article 102 of the Constitution being an equitable relief the High Court Division has to cautious while passing the judgment and order so that the relief which it is giving to the parties by the judgment and order is not beyond the terms of the Rule Nisi.

18. Reliance may be placed in the case of the Managing Director, Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited and others vs Md Tamjid Uddin and others, reported in 5 LM (AD) 130, wherein the points for determination by this Division were asunder:

"I. For that the High Court Division passed the impugned judgment and order declaring the promotion of the petitioners to the post of Assistant Managers to be unlawful and without jurisdiction should be set-aside inasmuch that the terms of the Rule Nisi issued in Writ Petition No. 651 of 2012 did not entail/cover the lawfulness of the petitioner's promotions.

II. For that the High Court Division passed the impugned judgment and order in breach of the principles of natural justice inasmuch that the petitioners were never made parry to the Writ Petition No. 651 of 2012, no Rule Nisi was ever issued or served upon them and nor were they asked or given an opportunity to present then-case before passing of the impugned judgment.

III. Because the cancellation of departmental promotion after two and half years and direction to take necessary steps for promotion in making the Rule disposed of, the High Court Division went beyond the scope of Article 102 of the Constitution and thereby usurped the function of the executive and, as such, the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set-aside."
19. To answer the aforesaid points, this Division in the said case has gone through the Rule Nisi issuing order, prayer formulated in the writ petition basing on which the Rule Nisi was issued along with the judgment and order impugned in that including the provision of Article 102 of the Constitution, and thereby held in paragraph No. 16 as follows:

"On perusal of the materials on record it appears that the High Court Division, while passing the impugned judgment, found the first part of the Rule, relating to "publishing the advertisement" has become infructuous due to completion of appointment by direct recruitment in 67% of the vacant posts and, as such, in the name of consequential relief it declared the entire process of promotion to the post of Assistant Manager, illegal and without lawful authority, although Rule Nisi was not issued on the entire promotion process concerning promotion, dated 27-12-2011, of the appellants of CA No. 135 of 2015, or any such prayer being specifically made in the writ petition."
20. This Division in that case also held as under:

"In the present case, on perusal of the writ petition, the prayer portion and the terms of the Rule issuing order, it appears that the writ petitioner did not make such prayer challenging the promotion of the present appellants nor any relief has been sought against them making them parties. As such the finding and decision of the High Court Division, so far it relates to 'declaring the promotion of the present appellants to be illegal and without lawful authority', is not a correct finding and decision and rather it is beyond the prayer as sought for. The same could have been correct if the writ petitioners would have challenged the present appellants' 2½ years earlier promotion making them parties and Rule being issued to that effect."
21. Further, reliance may be placed in the case of West Bengal, Home Department and others vs Ram Chandra Choudhury reported in AIR 1973 Col 220, it has been held in paragraph-32 as follows:

"............Orders for recovery of money can be made by this Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction, but only in a limited class of cases, namely, where the statutory provision under which money was paid was declared by this Court to be void or where money has been paid under orders which have been struck down. The third and the more formidable obstacle to the amendment of the petition, at this stage, is that an amendment relating to recovery of arrears of salary would be wholly beyond the terms of Rule Nisi which was made absolute by the trial Court This Court sitting in appeal over the judgment and order by which the Rule Nisi was made absolute, cannot, at this stage, enlarge the scope of the Rule Nisi to which a return has been filed by the appellants, so as to enable the respondent to agitate the question of recovery of his arrears of salary."
22. Thus, in the light of the aforesaid decision it is clear that granting of such relief beyond the terms of the Rule Nisi is not approved by this Division. The High Court Division should not have granted any relief different from the terms of the Rule Nisi issued as per prayer made in the writ petition.

23. Whether the High Court Division went beyond the scope of Article 102 of the Constitution, in giving relief beyond the terms of the Rule Nisi as in the present case, we need to see Article 102 of the Constitution as well as the High Court Division Rules which deal with writ petitions. Article 102(2) provides that 'the High Court Division on the application of any person aggrieved, may give such directions or orders to any person including any person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic, as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the fundamental right conferred by part III of this Constitution". So the person who wants to invoke Article 102 must be an aggrieved person and must specify the relief in his prayers. Chapter XIA of the Supreme Court (High Court Division) Rules, deals with preparing and tiling of writ petition under Article 102 of the Constitution. It provides that the aggrieved person must specifically set out the relief sought for. So, the writ petitioner must have specific claim in the form of prayer against such persons who are respondents, following which the Court can grant relief, if favourable, in accordance with law.

24. In the present cases, the High Court Division has delivered the impugned judgment and order basing on the " জাতীয়করণকৃত কলেজ শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্মীকরণ বিধিমালা, ২০১৮ " by which the earlier Rules of 2000 has been repealed and thereby directed the writ respondent-leave petitioner herein to absorb the writ petitioners-respondents herein as Lecturers in their concerned Government Colleges despite of the fact that the writ petitioners did not make any such claim in the form of prayer in the writ petition asking absorption under the aforesaid absorption Rules of 2018 nor the Rules Nisi were issued at that effect. As such, the High Court Division erred in law in travelling beyond the scope/terms of the Rules Nisi in both the writ petitions in giving relief to the writ petitioners while passing the impugned judgment and order. Thus, the finding of the High Court Division is not the correct reflection of the terms of the Rules Nisi and, as such, the same does not leg to stand in accordance with law.

25. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances we are of the view that the finding and decision arrived at by the High Court Division in both the civil petitions for leave to appeal being not based on proper appreciation of both the facts and law the same calls for interference by this Division. As such, we are inclined to set-aside the impugned judgment and order upon disposing of both the civil petitions for leave to appeal without granting any leave on the same.

In the result, these two civil petitions for leave to appeal are disposed of. The impugned judgment and orders of the High Court Division are set-aside.

Judgment
Obaidul Hassan, J: This Criminal Appeal No.127 of 2014 with Jail Appeal Nos.26 and 29 of 2014 is directed against the judgment and order dated 11-5-2014 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Death Reference No.07 of 2009 with Criminal Appeal Nos.616, 670 and 698 of 2009 with Jail Appeal Nos.155- 159 of 2009 accepting the Death Reference while dismissing all the appeal and thereby upholding the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 4-2-2009 passed by the learned Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Kushtia (hereinafter referred to as the Tribunal/trial Court) in Nari-o Shishu Nirjatan Case No.147 of 2004 arising out of Daulatpur Police Station Case No.26 dated 27-3- 2004 corresponding to GR No.69 of 2004 convicting the appellants under section 9(3) of the Nari-o- Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the Ain, 2003) and sentenced them to death by hanging and to pay a fine of Taka 1,00,000 each.

2. The prosecution case, in short, is that one Md Abdul Aziz alias Jhunu, father of the deceased Sabina Khatun lodged First Information Report (shortly, the FIR) with Daulatpur Police Station. Alleging that on the evening of 25-3-2004 his daughter Sabina Khatun (13) went to the house of neighbour Muna Mondal to watch television. As she did not return home, the inmates of Sabina's house went to the said residence to search for Sabina. One Rubina, wife of Azanur told them that the victim went away from their residence just after evening. They also looked for Sabina in every house of the village, but could not trace her. On 27-3-2004 at about 05-30 pm the informant came to know that a dead body has been found in the field of Lalnagar. Being informed, the informant, his wife, Hasina; daughter, Bedana; son, Mulluk Chand; along with other villagers, went to the place of occurrence and saw the naked dead body of Sabina Khatun, her mouth was fastened with her orhna. They saw several injury marks on her chest, both the thighs and sharp cutting injury on her private organ. Her body was partially decomposed and spreading bad smell. Later on, they came to know that one Samad first saw the dead body at the place of occurrence where he went to pluck buds of tobacco flowers. The informant suspected that the accused Mamun, Azanur, Sentu and others had raped and killed his daughter. On the basis of the said first information lodged by the informant, Daulatpur Police Station Case No.26 dated 27-3-2004 corresponding to GR No.69 of 2004 under section 9(3) of the Ain, 2000 was started.

3. Officer-in-Charge Md Faruk Ahmmed started to investigate the case. On his transfer Sub-Inspector (SI), Md Nabir Hossen investigated the case and finally when SI Md Nabir Hossain was transferred SI Md Mosaddek Hossen Khan completed the investigation and submitted charge-sheet. The investigating officer visited the place of occurrence and prepared the Inquest Report of the dead body in the presence of witnesses, prepared the sketch map with index, seized the alamats and examined the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. He duly sent the body of the deceased to the Kushtia General Hospital for Post-mortem. The post-mortem examination of the victim was done by a group of doctors, they were Dr. Ashok Kumar Saha, Dr. Arbinda Pal, Dr. Saleh Ahmmed and Dr. Abdus Salam. Ultimately, on conclusion of investigation of the case, the Investigating Officer submitted charge sheet being No.108 dated 25-7-2004 against the accused Azanur Rahman, Mamun, Shukur, Kamu (Kamrul) and Sentu under section 9(3) of the Ain, 2000.

4. Later, the case was duly sent to the Tribunal for trial. The learned Judge of the Tribunal on taking cognizance of the offence against the accused persons under section 9(3) of the Ain, 2000 framed charge against them. On being read over and explained the charge to the accused persons, they pleaded not guilty and asked for a trail.

5. On the closure of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the convict-appellants were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 whereupon they pleaded innocence. They informed the Tribunal that they would not adduce any evidence on their behalf.

6. The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination is that the appellants are innocent and have been falsely implicated in this case out of enmity and personal grudge and the accused appellants are not involved with the offence of committing rape on the deceased Sabina, and murdering her. The accused Sentu, son of Tizabuddin, is the brother of Montu. Sentu is not named in the FIR. It is also the case of the defence is that from the date of occurrence the accused persons were very much present in the locality and they did not flee-away. The victim was not at all subjected to the commission of rape by the appellants. The confessional statements of accused Mamun and Azanur are not true and voluntary. Owing to merciless torture and enticement of the police the accused persons were compelled to give involuntary confessional statements.

7. During the course of trial, the prosecution produced as many as 18 witnesses including the Medical Officer and the Investigating Officer. The trial Court after considering the evidence and materials on record found the accused persons Sentu, Mamun, Azanur Rahman, Shukur and Kamu (Kamrul) guilty under section 9(3) of the Ain, 2000 and sentenced them to death by its judgment and order dated 4-2- 2009.

8. Death sentence proceeding has been submitted to the High Court Division by way of Reference by the Tribunal and the Reference has been noted as Death Reference No.07 of 2009. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of the Tribunal, the convicts Shukur, Kamu alias Kamrul and Sentu preferred Criminal Appeal No.616 of 2009, convict Azanur Rahman preferred Criminal Appeal No.670 of 2009, convict Mamun preferred Criminal Appeal No.698 of 2009 before the High Court Division. Convict Mamun, Azanur Rahman, Md Shukur Ali, Kamu alias Kamrul and Sentu presented petition of appeals from jail, which have been numbered as Jail Appeal Nos.155, 156, 157, 158 and 159 of 2009 and the same were heard with Death Reference No.07 of 2009.

9. The High Court Division by .its judgment and order dated 11-5-2014 accepted the Death Reference and dismissed all the Criminal Appeals and Jail Appeals affirming the judgment and order passed by the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Kushtia.

10. Being aggrieved by, and dissatisfied with the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the High Court Division dated 11-5-2014, the convict-appellants, namely, Md Shukur Ali, Sentu, Mamun and Azanur Rahman preferred Criminal Appeal with Jail Appeal before this Division.

11. Mr SM Shahjahan, the learned advocate appearing along with Mr Raghib Rouf Chowdhury, the learned Advocate, appearing for the appellants in Criminal Appeal No.127 of 2014, Mr SM Aminul Islam, the learned advocate, appearing for the appellants in Jail Appeal Nos.26 and 29 of 2014, have taken us through the FIR, the inquest report, the post-mortem report, the charge-sheet, testimonies of the witnesses, the judgment and order passed by the Tribunal and the appellate Court (High Court Division), connected materials on record and submit that the High. Court Division failed to consider that the judgment and order of conviction is bad in law as well as in facts and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be set-aside. They further submit that the High Court Division failed to consider that the judgment and order of conviction is based on surmise and conjecture and not on legal evidence and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be set-aside. They also submit that the High Court Division failed to consider that the judgment and order of conviction has been passed by the Tribunal without applying its' judicial mind as the case was not proved by the prosecution witnesses beyond reasonable doubt and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be set-aside. They next submit that during trail the prosecution examined as many as 18 prosecution witnesses, but all the witnesses disowned the prosecution case and none of the witnesses witnessed the occurrence and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be set-aside. Moreover, they submit that there is no evidence against the appellants except inculpatory confessional statements made by co-accused, but the same cannot be used against the appellants without corroboration and cannot' be basis of conviction and it is not an evidence as per section 3 of the Evidence Act, 1872 and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be set-aside. They added that the High Court Division failed to consider that in the judgment and order of conviction passed by the learned Judge of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Daman Tribunal it was not considered that out of 18 witnesses PWs 10 and 11 deposed about the searching of the appellants, but their evidence was not supported by PWs 1, 11, 6, 13 and they deposed that at the time of occurrence three witnesses were present, but PWs 1, 2, 6 and PW 13 did not support this story. Rather those evidence were contradicted by PWs 6 and 13, PW 6 in his cross-examination stated that "আমি আসামীদের সন্দেহ করি না" and PW 13 in his cross-examination stated that "আসামীদের বাড়িতে আমরা কেহ যাই নাই।" So it appears that there is no circumstantial evidence against the appellants and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be set-aside. They also submit that the High Court Division failed to consider that in passing the judgment and order of conviction, the learned Judge of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Daman Tribunal did not consider that the confessional statement must be left out of consideration as it was contradicted by medical evidence. The absence of spermatozoa in the private organ of the deceased throws doubt on the prosecution story of rape. They also submitted that the doctor stated that the cause of death was strangulation, but confession do not disclose the same and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be set-aside. Besides, they submit that there is no evidence against the appellants except confession of co-accused which is not substantial evidence in convicting appellants without any other corroborative evidence, moreover it appears from the record that the victim went to watch television in a house, but the owner of that house was not examined and the witnesses Kanchan and Hasina and other witnesses did not disclose the name of the appellants in their evidence and the circumstantial evidence also did not prove the involvement of the appellants and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be set-aside. They again submitted that the confession of accused Mamun and Azanur Rahman were not made voluntarily and those are not true as no certificate was issued by the statement recording Magistrate in this regard and, as such, the said confession is a nullity in the eye of law and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be set aside.

12. They further submit that the allegation against the appellants does not come under section 9(3) of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Daman Ain, 2000 as the doctor opined that the death was due to asphyxia as a result of above mentioned injuries, caused by strangulation which was ante-mortem and homicidal in nature with rape, but the rape was not proved by any other evidence including medical certificate and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be set-aside. Finally, they submit that the learned Magistrate recorded confessional statement of the two accused, but did not follow the prescribed procedure as mentioned in section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and, as such, the confessional statements are not admissible evidence resulting a judgment invalid.

13. Mr Biswajit Debnath, the learned Deputy Attorney-General, appearing for the respondent-the State, made his submissions supporting the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and prays for dismissal of the appeal.

“সাবিনাদের বাড়ি থেকে আমাদের বাড়ি এক কিলো দূরে। তিজার প্রামাণিক এর ছেলে সেন্টুর সাথে সাবিনার ভালবাসা ছিল। সাবিনার বান্ধবী কাঞ্চন (পিং-রবেজল মণ্ডল) কে সেন্টু বলে সাবিনাকে সাবিনাদের বাড়ির পাশের তামাকের ক্ষেতে ডেকে আনতে বলে। সেন্টুর সাথে তার বন্ধু কামু (পিং-গনি মাস্টার) ছিল। ২৫-৩-২০০৪ তারিখ বৃহস্পতিবার রাত ৭/৮ টার দিকে কাঞ্চন সাবিনাকে ডেকে এনে দিয়ে বাড়িতে চলে যায়। সাবিনা, সেন্টু ও কামু তামাক ক্ষেতের মধ্যে বসে গল্প করতে থাকে। রাত হওয়ায় তারা সাবিনাকে বাড়িতে রাখতে যায়। বাড়ির কাছে গিয়ে সাবিনাকে খোঁজাখুঁজি হচ্ছে জেনে আবার মাঠের মধ্যে নিয়ে আসে। সেন্টু সাবিনাকে বলে চল বিয়া করব। সে সেন্টু ও সাবিনাকে বসিয়ে রেখে কামু টাকা আনার নাম করে বাড়িতে যাওয়ার কথা বলে শুকুর (পিং-কইমুদ্দিন মণ্ডল) কে ডেকে আনে। কামু ও শুকুর আজানুর কে ডাকতে আসে। কামু আজানুরকে বলে চল মাঠের মধ্যে কাজ আছে। ওরা তিনজন এসে আমাকে ডাকে। বলি যাইতে পারব না। তারা পীড়াপীড়ি করায় তাদের সাথে গেলাম। ৪ জন সাবিনা ও সেন্টুর কাছে পৌঁছানোর পর কামু সাবিনার মুখ চেপে ধরে। সেন্টু সাবিনার ওড়না দিয়ে সাবিনার মুখ বাঁধে। শুকুর সাবিনাকে কাধে করে তামাকের ক্ষেতের মধ্যে আনে। সেন্টু সাবিনার দুই হাত চেপে ধরে রাখে। কামু মুখ চেপে ধরে। শুকুর সালোয়ার ও কামিজ টেনে ছিঁড়ে গা থেকে খুলে ফেলে। শুকুর সাবিনার সাথে খারাপ কাজ করে। শুকুরের হয়ে গেলে সে সাবিনার মুখ চেপে ধরে। তখন কামু সাবিনার সাথে খারাপ কাজ করে। শুকুর ও কামু দুই হাত ধরে রাখে। তখন সেন্টু সাবিনার সাথে খারাপ কাজ করে। সেন্টু উঠে দাঁড়ানোর পর আজানুর খারাপ কাজ করে। তারপর আমি খারাপ কাজ করি। আমি যখন করি তখন সাবিনা হাত পা এড়িয়ে দেয়। মনে হয় অজ্ঞান হয়ে গিয়েছিল। শুকুর তার কোমরের থেক চাকু বের করে। আমি ও আজানুর জিজ্ঞাসা করি চাকু কি করিবি? বলে খুন করে ফেলতে হবে। আমরা বাধা দিই। তখন আমাদের শুকুর লাথি মারে। আমরা একটু সরে গিয়ে চোখ ঢেকে ফেলি। শুকুর চাকু দিয়ে আরও কয়টি কোপ দেয় তা অন্ধকার বুঝতে পারিনি। সাবিনাকে ধর্ষণ করার পের যে যারমত পালিয়ে যাই।”
54. The confessional statement of Azanur Rahman reads as follows:

“২৫-৩-২০০৪ তারিখে রাত্রি ১১ টা সাড়ে ১১ টার দিকে আমাকে শুকুর ও কামু এসে ডাকে। বলে মাঠে যেতে হবে। বলি কেন? বলে কাজ আছে। পীড়াপীড়ি করে আমাকে নিয়ে মামুনের বাড়ীতে যায়। মামুনকেও ডেকে নয়। মাঠের মধ্যে গিয়ে আমি সেন্টু ও সাবিনাকে দেখি। তারা পাশাপাশি বসেছিল। আমি কামুর কাছে জানতে পারি কাঞ্চনের মাধ্যমে TV দেখার নাম করে সাবিনাকে কামু ও সেন্টু ডাকায় আনে। সাবিনাকে দিয়ে কাঞ্চন চলে যায়। আমাদের ডেকে আনার পর কামু হঠাৎ সাবিনার মুখ চেপে ধরে। সেন্টু সাবিনার ওড়না দিয়ে সাবিনার মুখ বেধে ফেলে। শুকুর, কামু ও সেন্টু মিলে সাবিনাকে পেড়ে ফেলে। শুকুর সাবিনার জামা পায়জামা টেনে ছিঁড়ে ন্যাংটা করে ফেলে। সেন্টু মুখ চেপে ধরে রাখে। দুই হাত চেপে ধরে কামু। শুকুর দুই পা দুই হাত ধরে সাবিনার সাথে খারাপ কাজ করে। শুকুরের হাতে বড় নখ আছে তা দিয়ে সাবিনার দুধে জোরে টান দেয়। শুকুরের কাজ হয়ে গেলে কামু সাবিনার উপর চড়ে খারাপ কাজ করতে থাকে। শুকুর গিয়ে মুখ চেপে ধরে। কামুর হয়ে যাওয়ার পর সেন্টু খারাপ কাজ করে। তখন কামু গিয়ে সাবিনার হাত দুইটা ধরে। তখন মেয়েটা আর নড়াচড়া করছিল না। সেন্টুর হয়ে যাওয়ার পর আমি দাড়িয়ে ছিলাম। আমাকে শুকুর খারাপ কাজ করতে বলে। তখন আমার প্যান্টের চেইন খুলে সাবিনার সাথে খারাপ কাজ করি। তারপর আমি ওঠার পর মামুনকে খারাপ কাজ করার জন্য শুকুর বলে। তখন মামুন খারাপ কাজ করে। সাবিনা সেন্টু খারাপ কাজ করার সময় থেকে গা এড়িয়ে দিয়ে অজ্ঞান হয়ে যায়। আমি এবং কামু যখন খারাপ কাজ করি তখন তার জ্ঞান ছিল না। সবার খারাপ কাজ হয়ে যাওয়ার পর শুকুর তার কোমর থেকে চাকু বের করে। চাকু হঠাৎ শাঁট করে। আমি বলি কি করছিস? সে বলে একে খুন করব। আমি বাধা দিই। তখন আমাকে গালি দিয়ে লাথি মারে। মামুন বাধা দিলে তাকেও লাথি মারে। আমরা ভয়ে একটু দূরে গিয়ে দাঁড়াই। শুকুর চাকু মারছে এই শব্দ শুনতে পাই। সাবিনা একবার শুধু উঁ করে শব্দ করে। তার কোন শব্দ পাইনি। শুকুর বলে বাড়ি যায়। আমরা ভয়ে পালিয়ে যাই। আমি আর মামুন একবারে গীব বাসে ঢাকা যাই। ঘুরে ফিরে কোন কাজ না পেয়ে এক দিনই রাত ৯ টার বাসে কুষ্টিয়া চালের বাণ্ডার এ আমার খালার বাড়ীতে যাই। পরে আমার ভাই এসে পুলিশের হাতে ধরিয়ে দেয়।”
55. In the inquest report regarding the marks of injury on the dead body of the deceased it has been mentioned that there were seven marks of injuries with sharp knife on her chest, 2 marks of injuries on her thighs and one mark of injury on her private organ and his mouth was fastened with orhna. It is also mentioned' that deceased was raped before murder.

56. The injuries found on the dead body of the deceased after autopsy, have been mentioned in the preceding paragraphs during discussion of the evidence of PW 14 the doctor, who held the post-mortem.

57. So, the nature of injuries found in the inquest report as well as in the post-mortem report and in the inculpatory confessional statements made by Mamun and Azanur Rahman corroborate one another. The inculpatory confessional statements of Mamun and Azanur Rahman vividly narrated the circumstances how they committed rape and thereafter killed the deceased. The confessional statements support the inquest report as well as the post-mortem report.

58. From the deposition of PW 15, Md Nabirul Islam, Magistrate, 1st Class, and on perusal of confessional statements, it appears that the statements were recorded by the learned Magistrate following all the provisions required by law to be followed at the time of recording the confessional statements. PW 15 stated that the confessional statements made by Mamun and Azanur were clone voluntarily and it was true. The appellants Mamun and Azanur made confessional statements incriminating themselves along with Shukur, Sentu and Kamrul. Now, the question arises whether the confessional statements of Mamun and Azanur can be used against Shukur and Sentu.

59. Section 30 of the Evidence Act, 1872 provides that as follows:

"30. When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the Court may take into consideration such confession as against such other persons as well as against the person who makes such confession."
60. The ingredients of this section are that:

More persons than one are to be tried jointly for the same offence.
One of such persons has to make confessional statement affecting himself and others. and
Such confession can be taken into consideration by the Court against others as well as the maker of the confession.
61. In the instant case, the appellants Mamun and Azanur made inculpatory confessional statements which vividly narrated the crime committed by all of them. They made the inculpatory confessional statements incriminating themselves along with other co-accused and the defence failed to prove any personal enmity or grudge of Mamun and Azanur with the non-confessing appellants Shukur, Sentu and Kamu. Moreover, PWs 1, 10 and 11 gave evidence to the effect that they suspected the involvement of all the accused in the occurrence as they were missing after the occurrence and appellants Mamun and Azanur were arrested on such suspicion. In their confessional statements, both of them in a voice narrated the role played by themselves and other accused persons in the occurrence and there is no inconsistency in their statements which leads us to believe the confessional statements of Mamun and Azanur involving Shukur and Sentu in the said occurrence are true.

62. Moreover, the deposition of PWs 1, 10 and 11 regarding the absconding of Shukur and Sentu along with Mamun and Azanur after the occurrence took place, provides strong corroboration to the confessional statements of Mamun and Azanur. Besides, the post-mortem report and the depositions of the witnesses clearly it reveals that there was sign of rape on the victim girl and accordingly, the appellants Mamun and Azanur confessed about the role played by all of them at the time of committing rape. The confessional statements of Mamun and Azanur are not contradictory rather they in a voice categorically stated the acts committed by each of them.

63. It is true that there is no eye-witness in the instant case but the inculpatory, true and voluntary confessional statements of two accused and the circumstances particularly long absconding by Shukur and Sentu are so well, connected to indicate that those circumstances render no other hypothesis other than the involvement of the appellants Shukur, Sentu, Mamun and Azanur in the alleged rape and murder thereof.

64. In performing our duties, this court is charged with the task of not only assessing the facts against the law, but also considering the impacts of judgments that are pronounced and any assessment made on the overall justice system,.

65. With modern criminal justice mechanism, the right against self-incrimination is one that stands as a cornerstone. As such confessions by a co-accused are generally inadmissible against the accused in a concerned case. However, in our duties of administering justice, we are sometimes faced with a case that forces us to consider aspects of larger policy at play.

66. The balance between crime control and due process models of justice is such a consideration that requires reassessment with changing times and upon the fact of each case. The case before us is one of such a heinous crime, where measures of control are made far more necessary to ensure that justice can be brought to the victim in question, As such while due process is still of utmost importance: crime control considerations must be made as well.

67. As such, the considerations of the use of a co-accused's confession, where supported by corroborating evidence, in the face of an overwhelming presence of circumstantial evidence, must be made. In this instance, the accused's absconding prior to trial, suggests an intent to obstruct justice. Corroborative evidence presented by the prosecution shows that there is sufficient reason to suggest that the co-accused's accounts of the events are likely to be true. It is therefore, that this court is of the opinion that in order to pursue a model of crime control in this regard, this court is willing to admit, in such rare instances the confession of a co-accused as incriminating evidence against the other accused. Albeit such evidence is still circumstantial.

68. The principle of the right against self incrimination is also accompanied by the principle that upon silence on part of those incriminated adverse inferences may be drawn at any stage of the trial and pretrial procedures.

69. When the co-accused, Azanur and Mamun put forth their confessions, incriminating the accused Shukur and Sentu, they had the opportunity to present their accounts of the events in question. Their refusal to adduce defence witness and to give any statement, allows this Court to draw an adverse inference against them, in conjunction with the inferences drawn from the period of their absconding.

70. We hold that confessional statement of a co-accused can be used against others non-confessing accused if there is corroboration of that statement by other direct or circumstantial evidence. In the instant case, the makers of the confessional statements vividly have stated the role played by other co-accused in the rape incident and murder of the deceased which is also supported/corroborated by the inquest report, post-mortem report and by the depositions of the witnesses particularly the deposition of PWs 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 18 regarding the marks of injury on the body of the deceased. Every case should be considered in the facts and circumstances of that particular case. In light of the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are of the view that the confessional statement of a co-accused can be used for the purpose of crime control against other accused persons even if there is a little bit of corroboration of that confessional statement by any sort of evidence either direct or circumstantial. Thus, the accused namely Shukur and Sentu are equally liable like Azanur and Mamun for murdering the deceased after committing rape.

71. We are also of the view that confession of Azanur and Mamun and the inculpatory facts furnished by the circumstances appearing from the evidence as discussed above are incompatible with the innocence of the appellant Shukur and Sentu.

72. In consideration of the matters discussed above, we are of the view that the deceased Sabina was raped before murder. The post-mortem report shows that her death was due to asphyxia caused by strangulation which was ante-mortem and homicidal in nature with rape. The marks injuries found on her body as well as the discovery of .naked dead body which was supported by the witnesses i.e. PWs 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 11 clearly indicate .that she was raped before Murder. It is a strong circumstantial evidence that the deceased was raped before murder 'by the appellants.

73. In the light of the discussions we may conclude that the prosecution has been able to prove the charge against all the appellants beyond reasonable doubt and the Tribunal has rightly convicted and sentenced the appellants to death and the confirmation thereof by the High Court Division is justified. We find no cogent reason to interfere with the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.

74. In the instant case, it is found that the deceased Sabina was a girl of 13 years and she had a relation with Sentu. On the date of occurrence, the deceased went to meet with Sentu. At one moment Sentu along with other appellants, namely Shukur Ali, Mamun and Azanur to fulfill their nefarious desire raped Sabina and thereafter, Appellant Shukur Ali killed the deceased with a knife which he brought with him. Before killing, appellant Shukur Ali stabbed Sabina with the knife on the different parts of her body including on her private organ which resulted to her harrowing death.

75. Mr SM Shahjahan learned advocate appearing for the appellant Shukur lastly drew our attention regarding the age of the appellants and submits that Shukur Ali was very young at the time of offence, 'the other appellants were also of very tender age, considering their age the sentence of death may be reduced.

76. In this regard it is pertinent to mention the observation of his Lordship HL Dattu former Honorable Chief Justice of India & two other honorable judges of the Supreme Court made in the case of Mofil Khan vs State of Jharkhand, (2015) 1 SCC 67, Para-20 that "Sentences of severity are imposed to reflect the seriousness of the crime, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offence, to afford adequate deterrent to criminal conduct and to protect the community from further similar conduct. It serves a threefold purpose-punitive, deterrent and protective."

77. Regarding appropriate punishment and sentence his Lordship Mr Justice P. Sathasivam, J. in the case of Ahmed Hussain Pali Mohammed Saiyed vs State of Gujarat, (2009) 7 SCC 254, Paras 99 & 100 observed that "Justice demands that courts should impose punishment befitting the crime so that the courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime. The court must not only keep in view the rights of the victim of the crime but the society at large while considering the imposition of appropriate punishment. The court will be failing in its duty if appropriate punishment is not awarded for a crime which has been committed not only against the individual victim but also against the society to which both the criminal and the victim belong."

78. We are of the view that undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence on the judiciary. It is the duty of the Court to award appropriate sentence considering the gravity of the offence. Considering the nature and gravity of the, offence committed by the appellant Shukur Ali, we are of the view that the cruelty and violence with which he killed Sabina, the ends of justice demands his death sentence.

79. From the Materials on record, it appears that the appellants Sentu, Mamun and Azanur are in the condemned cell for more then 12(twelve) years Suffering the pangs of death. It was held in the case of Nazrul Islam (Md) vs State reported in [66 DLR (AD) 199] that, "Lastly' with regard to the period of time spent by the accused in the condemned cell, there are numerous decisions of this Division which shed light on this aspect. In general terms, it may be stated that the length of period spent by a convict in the condemned cell is not necessarily a ground for commutation of the sentence of death. However, where the period spent in the condemned cell is not due to any fault of the convict and where the period spent there is inordinately long, it may be considered as an extenuating ground sufficient for commutation of sentence of death." In view of the decision cited above as well as the circumstances of this case, we are of the view that justice would be sufficiently met if the sentence of death of the appellants Sentu, Mamun and Azanur be commuted to one of imprisonment for life.

80. Accordingly, the Criminal Appeal No.127 of 2014 is dismissed. The sentence of death of the appellant in respect of condemned-prisoner, namely Md Shukur Ali is maintained.

81. The sentence of death in respect of the appellant condemned-prisoner, namely, Sentu, son of Tijabuddin, Village-Lalnagor, Police Station-Daulatpur, District-Kushtia is commuted to imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Taka 50,000(fifty thousand), in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 02(two) years more. He will get the benefit of section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 in calculation of his sentence: The concerned Jail Authority is directed to shift the appellant to the normal jail from the condemned cell forthwith.

82. Jail Appeal No.26 of 2014 is dismissed with modification of sentence.

83. The sentence of death of appellant condemned-prisoner, namely, Mamun, son of Sirajul Pramanik of Village-Lalnagor, Police Station-Daulatpur, District-Kushtia is commuted to imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Taka 50,000(fifty thousand), in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 02(two) years more. However, he will get the benefit of section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 in calculation of his sentence. The concerned jail authority is directed to shift the appellant to the normal jail from the condemned cell forthwith.

84. Jail Appeal No.29 of 2014 is dismissed with modification of sentence.

85. The sentence of death of appellant condemned-prisoner, namely, Azanur Rahman, son of Talemuddin Mondal, Village-Lalnagor, Police Station-Daulatpur, District-Kushtia is commuted to imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Taka 50,000 (fifty thousand), in default, to suffer imprisonment for 02(two) years more. He will get the benefit of section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure in calculation of his sentence. The concerned jail authority is directed to shift the appellant to the normal from the condemned cell forthwith.

Jail Appeal No.29 of 2014 in respect of the appellant Sentu, is redundant in the light of the judgment in Criminal appeal No.127 of 2014.
