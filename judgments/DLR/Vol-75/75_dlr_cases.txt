Judgment
Naima Haider, J:

1. This application filed by Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust/BLAST in the nature of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to ensure the fundamental rights of equality between women and men. The petitioners felt aggrieved by the continued inclusion of a provision in the prescribed marriage registration forms (kabinnamah) (BG Form Nos. 1600 and 1601), which perpetuates discrimination between women and men, and also by the failure to require photographs of the parties to be submitted when registering marriages. Under Muslim law as applicable in Bangladesh, marriages are required to be registered in the prescribed form (the Kabinnamah) pursuant to section 3 and 5 of The Muslim Marriages and Divorce (Registration) Act, 1974 ["The 1974 Act"] read with Rule 28(1)(a) of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Rules, 1974 ["The 1974 Rules"]. The rules have been further amended in 2009.

2. The distressing matter of fact is that after conclusion of the registration procedure of marriage by the parties, Form No. 1600 is kept with the Kazi's office and Form No. 1601 is provided to the parties. Both forms at clause No. 5 require the bride to make a statement as to her marital status and her sexual history, specifically stating whether she is unmarried or virgin/ widowed/divorced. In contrast, the forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/divorced /previously married or is a virgin.

3. Such a clause targeting the women in particular and which is so discriminating and arbitrary that it has created inequality between bride and groom as only the bride is required to provide her personal information regarding marital status, sexual history etc. which is being robustly violative of fundamental rights, in particular the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sex, the right to be treated in accordance with law, as guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution. Interference with such privacy also violates a women's right to personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 31 and 32 of the constitution.

4. Inclusion of the Word "Kumari" instead of "Unmarried" is humiliating and degrading the women's personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 32of the constitution and contradicts with Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) inasmuch as it has the effect of discrimination against women on the basis of sex, also impairing the dignity of woman by invading upon their privacy. This Court issued Rule in the following terms:

"Why the entry No. 5 in Forms No. 1600 and 1601 should not be declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect being discriminatory against women on the ground of sex and marital status in violation of Articles 28, 31 and 32 of the Constitution, and as to why the respondents should not be directed to take necessary action:

(i) to amend the Bangladesh Forms No. 1600 and 1601 (kabinnama), by omitting the use of the word "Kumari" in respect of brides, and,
(ii) to ensure that information regarding marital status (never married/ married but divorced/marriage subsisting/) is required in respect of both men and women without any discrimination, and
(iii) to impose a mandatory requirement for both the bride and groom to affix their respective photos to these forms, and
iv) to produce National ID Card at the time of registration of marriage."
5. Mr ZI Khan Panna, the learned senior advocate appearing for the Petitioner with learned advocate Ms. Aynunnahar Siddiqua submits that the writ petition has been filed bona fide in the public interest to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to ensure the fundamental rights of equality between women and men, the impugned inclusion of a provision in the prescribed marriage registration forms (kabin-namah) (BG Form Nos. 1600 and 1601), which perpetuates discrimination between women and men, and also by the failure to require photographs of the parties to be submitted when registering marriages. He further submits that after conclusion of the registration procedure of marriage by the parties, Form No. 1600 is kept with the Kazi's office and Form No. 1601 is provided to the parties, both forms at clause No. 5 require the bride to make a statement as to her marital status and her sexual history, specifically stating whether she is unmarried or virgin/ widowed/divorced, in contrast, the forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/divorced/ previously married or is a virgin.

6. Learned advocate for the Petitioner vehemently submits that the impugned requirement is so discriminating and arbitrary that it has created inequality between bride and groom as only the bride is required to provide her personal information regarding marital status, sexual history etc. which is being robustly violative of fundamental rights, in particular the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sex, the right to be treated in accordance with law, as guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution and interference with such privacy also violates a women's right to personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 31 and 32 of the constitution.

7. Mr Amit Talukder, the learned Deputy Attorney-General entered appearance by filing affidavit-in opposition on behalf of the respondent No. 1.

8. The case of the respondent No. 1 is that the Rule 10 of the Muslim Family Law Rules, 1961 as framed under the Muslim Family Ordinance, 1961 provided a prescribed form No. II wherein at serial No.5 the words virgin/ maiden/widow or divorced were inserted. Thereafter, under Rule (1) (Ka) of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Rules, 2009 has formed under the Muslim Marriage and Divorce (Registration) Act, 1974 provided a prescribed form as Form-Gha wherein at Serial No.5, the similar words were inserted as virgin/ maiden/widow or divorced lawfully.

9. Mr Amit Talukder, the learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 1 submits that prescribed Forms for registering marriage (kabin-Nama) has been inserted under the provision of Rules 27(1)(Ka) in the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Rules, 2009 which has no intention to hurt the privacy of women.

10. Mr Ishrat Hasan, the learned Advocate entered appearance by filing affidavit in opposition on behalf of the respondent No. 5.

11. The case of the respondent No. 5 is that the right to freedom of religion is an important right of the citizens of every modern state and article 41(1)(a) of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh protects the citizen's fundamental right freely to profess, practice, and propagate religion. The protection given to this right is not absolute. It is subject to law, public order and morality as article 41(1) itself denotes. The freedom enunciated in this article 41 is a personal freedom. It is a freedom which a person can claim for his personal exercise at will. The freedom guaranteed in this article is the right of any person to entertain such religious views as appeal to his individual conscience without interference by any person or power, civil or ecclesiastical, is as fundamental in a free state as is the right life and liberty. Religion, in this article, includes all form of belief in the existence of superior beings exercising power over human beings by violation, and imposing rules of conduct, with regards in the present life as well as with future rewards and punishments in life hereinafter. The religion under the constitution need not be theistic. Citizens irrespective of their religious beliefs are entitled to the right envisaged in this article. All shall enjoy equal constitutional guarantee. Among religions our constitution adopted Islam as the state religion of the Republic at the same time ensuring equal status and equal right in the practice of the Hindu, Buddhist, Christain and other religions. Whereas, religion of a person is his own belief, contention of inequity cannot be applied here.

12. Mr ishrat Hasan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No.5 submits that the petitioner alleges this term "Kumari" is humiliating, unreasonable and degrading and at the same time violative of fundamental rights protected by articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution. The respondent No.5 disagrees with this contention. In Bangladesh sexual intercourse between an adult man and adult women is not offence. So, if any women had sexual intercourse before marriage and give birth to a child remaining unmarried later marriages someone hiding existence of her child and then the consequences would be adverse. The man to whom she is married will put her to a grave dispute regarding the parentage of child and she may face the litigation of fraud. Another consequence is that if she is one month or two months pregnant at the time of marriage and after her marriage according to section 112 of the Evidence Act, 1872 the husband will be the father of the child. Then question DNA test will arise and ultimately litigation.

13. In the midst of the bearing, this Court felt it necessary to invite one/more advocates to assist this Court on the issues of Islamic family laws and jurisprudence, one of the learned advocates of the Bar, namely, Mr M Belayet Hossain voluntarily came forward and expressed his intention to act as an intervener in this matter. Accordingly, we have allowed him to assist this Court.

14. The intervener learned advocate Mr M Belayet Hossain submits that the issues involved in this Rule touch the Constitutional regime of equality, privacy and freedom of religion. He submits that this Court should, in disposing of the Rule, examine the essentials of a valid Muslim marriage, legal and shareeah characteristics of an Islamic wedlock. He has categorically submitted that the essentials of a muslim marriage are that there should be a proposal, made by or on behalf of the parties to the marriage, and acceptance of the proposal by or on behalf of the other, in the presence of two witnesses who must be sane adult Muslims, at one meeting, although traditional Islamic family law does not require a marriage to be registered, the 1961 Ordinance, 1974 Act, 1975 Rules and 2009 Rules require a muslim marriage to be compulsorily registerable, failure to register a marriage has been made an offence, the solemnization of marriage if validly effected might not be affected for non-registration of the marriage, but the non registration of the marriage causes a doubt on the solemnization of the marriage itself, although marriage may be presumed from prolonged and continued cohabitation as was held in ALM Abdullah vs Rokeya Khatoon reported in 21 DLR 213. He further draws our attention to the decision reported in 8 ADC (2011) 855 (Momtaz Begum vs Anowar Hossain) wherein the Appellate Division observed that marriage among Muslims is not a sacrament but purely a civil contract, marriage brings about a relationship based on and arising from a permanent contract for intercourse and procreation of children between a man and a woman. A marriage contract, as a civil institution, rests on the same footing as other contracts. Though generally solemnized with recitation form the Qur'an, no specific ceremonies or religious rites are necessary for contracting a valid marriage, nor is evidence in writing required. Thus, deletion of the impugned word or re-phrasing the same in a more sensible way will not in any way affect the personal laws of the Muslim citizens inasmuch no religious script made the impugned disclosure in public a requirement for validity of a marriage, rather the principles of Islamic jurisprudence do not sanction publicity of one's sexual history or disclosure of such a private issue in a public document, he submits.

15. Mr M. Belayet Hossain argues that the submission made on behalf of the added respondent to the extent that 'the word—kumari-should be there to determine the issue of consent in a marriage as a girl who has not experienced sexual cohabitation in the past must not be married to a man without her consent' is misconceived inasmuch the conduct of a girl of a tender age in wedlock is observed by her wakil/guardian and the witnesses to the ceremony who are required to put their signatures in the impugned kabinnama on being satisfied that the essential ingredients of the marriage have been satisfied, and the other clauses of the impugned kabinnama e.g. clauses 7, 8, 11, 19 are sufficient to deal with the issue of consent of the girl, the kazis appointed for the purpose of registration of Muslim marriages are required to follow the legal and shariah principles in respect of the conditions and warranties to be satisfied in a wedlock and generally they explain the same before the parities/their agents or wakils/guardians. Thus making a provision for mandatory disclosure of a fact vis-a-vis sexual experience/in experience of a girl is a superfluous act. Moreover, since the impugned term takes different meanings at different places should be deleted from such a public document that carries solemnity, sanctity and religious fabrics. He submits —'obviously The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 [Act No. XXVI of 1973] made provision for the application of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) to Muslims in Bangladesh, and by the Laws Continuance Enforcement Order, 1971 all laws that were in force in Pakistan, continued to be in force in Bangladesh (this provision was substituted by Article 149 of the 1972 Constitution), therefore, Bangladesh inherited all personal laws along with the citizens' personal laws, but no personal law sanctions mandatory disclosure of a sexual history in a written document or in a marriage session/ceremony, rather Islam discourages disclosure of a very private issue to members of the public', therefore, the deletion of the term—kumari—from the impugned kabinnama will not affect any provision of the personal laws of Muslims.

16. He finally submits, additionally, that in a society where hundreds of child marriages (with or without taking consent from girls) are taking place despite there being strict application of the restraining laws, where forced sexual intercourse/ rape etc. takes place at urban and rural areas, forcing a girl to disclose her sexual history in that circumstance in a duly solemnized marriage ceremony (on repudiation of the previous marriage in cases of forced/child marriage or in a wedlock of a rape victim) is out and out a degrading treatment towards her and that attracts the Constitutional provisions of right to privacy, right to be treated equally and in accordance with law, moreover, public policy or social morality prohibits such an arrangement in a formal written declaration.

17. We have considered the submissions advanced by the learned advocates, perused the petition, affidavits-in-opposition, application for addition of party, provisions of the relevant laws, judgments and the extracts taken from the books written by the scholars in the relevant fields.

18. This Court is of the view that since the issue of Muslim marriage is primarily guided by the personal laws of the Muslim citizens of the Republic and since the 1937 Act recognized the personal laws (Shariat) of Muslims as laws of the land and since the framers of the 1972 Constitution did guarantee the right to practice and propagate religions in the Republic, it should not examine the constitutional legitimacy of the impugned entry made into the Kabinnama without considering the legal and jurisprudential aspects of Islamic/muslim marriage (in Arabic Nikah) in the instant context. Thus, we will be examining the constitutional, legal and Islamic jurisprudential aspects of the issues in question, additionally, we will take international obligation vis-à-vis the non-discriminatory treatment towards women into consideration in disposing of the Rule.

Issues for determination by this Court

19. In the above premises, we will deal with the following:

a) Whether the impugned entry is violative of the equality right of the women of the Republic or whether such an insertion has affected the non-discriminatory character of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh ;

b) Whether deletion/rephrasing of the impugned entry will in anyway infringe violate any marriage to be entered into by muslim male and female under Mohamedan Law.

Pathology of the impugned entry:

20. The relevant part of the impugned kabinnama is inserted below:

21. The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (Ordinance No. VIII of 1961) promulgated to give effect to certain recommendations of the then Commission on Marriage and Family Laws ["the 1961 Ordinance"] in its section 5 made a provision for registration of marriages which was omitted by section 15 of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974 (Act No. LII of 1974) ["the 1974 Act"]. Pursuant to the promulgation of the 1961 Ordinance, the Muslim Family Laws Rules, 1961 were framed ["the 1961 Rules"]. Form -II appended to the said Rules was called Nikah-Nama that contained in clause (5) the following : ........ (5) Whether the bride is a maiden , a widow or a divorcee Translated in Bangla as (৫) কনে কুমারী, বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা

And for the bridegroom, there was no such provision, although in clause (21) it required "Whether the bride-groom has any existing wile..."

22. Subsequently, on 24th July, 1974, the 1974 Act came into being, pursuant to which on 1st July, 1975, the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Rules, 1975 ["the 1975 Rules"] were framed by the then Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Form E[nikahnama in Bangla] appended to the 1975 Rules contains a clause namely clause 5 that runs as follows:

"(৫) কনে কুমারী, বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা"
23. In contrast, the forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/divorced /previously married or is a virgin.

24. The Government vide SRO No. 201-Ain/2009 framed new Rules namely মুসলিম বিবাহ ও তালাক (নিবন্ধন) বিধিমালা, ২০০৯ ["the 2009 Rules"] by virtue of section 14 of the 1974 Act repealing the earlier rules/1975 Rules. Although the previous rules had been repealed, the form suggested therein contains the similar clause. Form Gha appended to the 2009 Rules reads, amongst the others, the following :

"(৫) কনে কুমারী, বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা ?..............
২১। বরের কোন স্ত্রী বর্তমানে আছে কি না এবং থাকিলে অন্য বিবাহে আবদ্ধ হইবার জন্য বর ১৯৬১ সালের মুসলিম পারিবারিক আইন অধ্যাদেশ মোতাবেক সালিসী কাউন্সিলের অনুমতি লইয়াছে কি না?...........
২২। অন্য বিবাহে আবদ্ধ হইবার জন্য সালিসী কাউন্সিলের নিকট হইতে বরের নিকট প্রেরিত অনুমতি পত্রের নম্বর ও তারিখ..........."
25. Although Muslim marriages and divorces are compulsorily registerable under laws now in force in Bangladesh, Hindu marriages have not been made compulsorily registerable as such under the newly enacted laws namely হিন্দু বিবাহ নিবন্ধন আইন, ২০১২ came into force on 27th January, 2013 and হিন্দু বিবাহ নিবন্ধন বিধিমালা, ২০১৩ came into force on 27th January, 2013. Clause 6 of the Form Gha appended to the Rules 2013 reads :

"৬। কন্যা কুমারী অথবা বিধবা কিনা?.........."
26. Now we should look into the dictionary meaning of the word - কুমারী. Bengali — English Dictionary, published by the Bangla Academy, June , 1994 defines the word at page 133 as under:

.n. 1. an unmarried girl of marriageable age, a virgin, a maiden. 2. Woman who remains single after the conventional age of marrying, a spinster, 3. A daughter : state of being a virgin; virginity...'

27. Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 7th Edition, 2005, Oxford University Press defines the word 'virgin' as: 'a person who has never had sex', and defines 'spinster' as " ..(old fashioned, often disappointing) a woman who is not married , especially an older woman who is not likely to many [this word should not now be used to mean simply a woman who is not married.. "

History of Bangladesh in respect of Registration of Muslim Marriages in this Region :

28. We have perused the relevant pages of Muslim Law in India and abroad authored by Dr. Tahir Mahmood (one of the most celebrated legal scholars in this sub-continent), he has summed up the history [at pages 53-65] of legislation in the field of muslim marriage and divorce in this region in a precise manner and style. Dr Mahmood writes

‘......... A Kazis Bill was introduced in the central legislature in 1879 with a long Statement of Objects and Reasons explaining why the government's power to appoint official kazis had been withdrawn, what problems its action had created, and why it was being resumed, the Kazi, in this country; before the advent of British rule, appears to have performed certain other duties, partly of a secular and partly of a religious nature. The principal function of these Kazis seems to have been preparing, attesting and registering deeds of transfer of property, celebrating marriages, and performing other rites and ceremonies. It is not apparent that any of these duties were incumbent on the Kazi as such. It is probable that the customary performance of them by him arose rather from his being a public functionary and one known by his official position to be acquainted with the law, than form his having, as Kazi, a greater claim to perform them than anyone else.

Such was the position of the Kazi in this country under Native Government. On the introduction of the British rule, Judges and Magistrates took the place of Kazis, and the Kazi in his judicial capacity disappeared. But the British Government, though no longer recognizing the judicial functions of the Kazi did not abolish the office. By certain Regulations passed from time to time the appointment of Kazi-ul Kuzat and Kazis by the State was provided for and the performance of their non-judicial duties was recognized by law.’

29. We note from the submission made by Mr M Belayet Hossain that currently there are Muslim Marriages and Divorce Registration Acts in force in six States of India for voluntary registration of marriages and divorces among the local Muslims. The States are: West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Orissa and Meghalaya. The parent Law among these is the old Bengal Mohammedan Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1876 which is now in force in the first three of the names States. The Orissa legislature re-enacted in 1949, with some changes, the old Bengal law of 1876 titles The Orissa Mohammedan Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1949 it extends to the whole State. The Assam legislature had enacted a similar law in 1935 titled: The Assam Moslem Marriage and Divorce Registration Act.

30. The 1876 Act made elaborate provisions for voluntary registration of marriages and divorces with the so-called Mohammedan Registrars, laid down their powers and function, and provided forms for registration by them. It empowered the provincial governments to make rules to provide other details for carrying out the purposes of the Act, which were soon issued. The Act was of an administrative nature and clarified the nature of its provisions in the following words:

Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed to:

(a) render invalid merely by reason of its not having been registered any Mohammedan marriage or divorce which could otherwise be valid;

(b) render valid by reason of its having been registered any Mohammedan marriage or divorce which could otherwise be invalid;

31. The most important provision of the Act was the one requiring the Mohammedan Registrars to periodically transmit their records to the District Registrars. The system was to be helpful in maintaining official records of marriages among the Muslims. The provision was borrowed mutatis mutandis, from the Christian Marriage Act 1872.

32. Unlike the Bengal Act of 1876, The Kazis Act does not provide any form for certification of marriages by the kazis. The kazis, both official and private, do keep forms of nikahnama [marriage agreement] but there is no uniform or standard form used for this purpose everywhere. The basic things mentioned in every nikahnama are names, age, parentage and address of parties and the amount and nature of dower. The document is signed by the parties or their vakils [guardians or their nominees] and gawahs [witnesses]. and authenticated by the kazi. The documents carry great weight as proof of marriage. Evidence of the kazis preparing nikahnama and the witnesses signing them is considered to be satisfactory proof of marriage.

33. The UN Convention for Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women promulgated in 1979 required all state parties to introduce measures for compulsory registration of marriages. The Indian government ratified the Convention but with some reservations in that matter. From 2006 onward the Supreme Court of India [without mentioning the government's reservation on the CEDAW provision] repeatedly issued directions that registration of all marriages among all communities should be made compulsory throughout India. Seema vs Ashwini kumar, AIR 2006 SC 1158.

34. Pre-Independence and Post-Independence positions in Bangladesh: Muslim Family Laws Ordinance: The Bengal, Bihar and Orissa Mohammedan Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1876 had remained in force in East Pakistan after the partition of India. No such law existed in any of the provinces of British India which as a result of partition of India in 1947 had become West Pakistan, and now constitute the whole of Pakistan. Only the central Kazis Act was extended to some places Under the Muslim family Laws ordinance promulgated by the federal government in Pakistan in 1961, and made applicable to both West and East Pakistan, section 5 provided for compulsory registration of all marriages in the country. Non registration would be punishable offence but will not affect the validity of marriage. After the creation of Bangladesh as a new State in 1972 the Ordinance remained in force there.

35. New Bangladesh Act: In 1973 Bangladesh amended the old Mohammedan Marriages and Divorces Registration of 1876, and next year replaced it with a new Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act 1974. The new Act repealed section 5 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961 [relating to registration of marriages] in its application in Bangladesh. Statutory rules under the new Act were framed in 1975 and amended on several occasions as we have seen above. Currently the 2009 Rules are in force.

36. Although the said States of the Union of India made several provisions for voluntary registration of muslim marriages, enactment of such law was halted in Jammu and Kashmir. THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR MUSLIM MARRIAGES REGISTRATIONACT, 1981 (Act No. XXII of 1981) was enacted in 1981 providing for compulsory registration, but had to be soon withdrawn due to stiff opposition by community leaders. Dr. Mahmood observes:

There is a feeling in Muslim religious circles that compulsory registration of a religious marriage would have the effect of converting it into a civil marriage no more to be governed by the personal law, due to which they have not been in favour of it. Their understanding of the matter is absolutely incorrect and they need to be properly educated about it. Whatever be the position of registration of marriages, voluntary or compulsory, it is merely an administrative process having nothing to do with any substantive aspect of marriage. Registration does not change a religious marriage into a civil marriage and even after registration it continues to be governed by the personal law of the parties.

37. It appears the SCHEDULE prescribed by the Act [under sections 2(a) and 3]. Contents to be maintained in a nikah registration form :

1. Place of marriage (with sufficient particulars to locate the Place.) 2. (a) Full name of the bride-groom. (b) His age. (c) His place of residence. (d) Address. (e) Full name of bridegroom's father. (f) Whether father is alive or dead. (g) Civil condition of the bridegroom at the time of marriage whether—Un-married, Widower Divorced Married, and if so, how many wives are alive. (h) Signature or thumb impression of the bridegroom/ Vakil/Guardian according as the Nikah was performed in person by the bridegroom or through his Vakil or Guardian. 3. (a) Full name of the bride. (b) Her age. (c) Her place of residence. (d) Address. (e) Full name of the bride's father. (f) Whether father is alive or dead. (g) Civil condition of the bride at the time of marriage whether—Un-married Widow Divorced. (h) Signature or thumb impression of the bride/Vakil/Guardian according as the Nikah was performed in person by the bride or through her Vakil or Guardian.

38. We may now have a look at the relevant parts of the Form used in registration of Muslim marriages in West Bengal. For ready reference the same is quoted below :

Schedule to the 1876 Act Muslims
(See sections 6 and 11)
Form A
Book I
Register of Marriages (as prescribed by section 6 of the Act for the voluntary registration of Mohammadan Marriages and Divorces).
4. Whether the bride is a spinster, a widow or divorced by a former husband and whether she is adult or otherwise.
5. [Name of the guardian of the bride-groom (if the bride-groom be a minor) and that of the guardian's father, with specification of the guardian's residence, and of the relationship in which he stands to the bride-groom.]
6. [Name of the guardian of the bride (if she be a minor) and that of his father, with specification of his residence, and the relationship in which he stands to the bride.]

39. The form used in West Bengal for registration of Muslim marriages uses the word -'spinster' in place of kumari, considering the definition given by the Oxford Dictionary (quoted above) it may be reasonably concluded that both `virgin' and 'spinster' are equally degrading.

Constitutional aspects and international obligations in respect of gender equality: is the impugned entry to the kabinnama violative of the Constitutional and international obligations?

40. Ours is a Constitutional democracy where constitutionalism and rule of law prevail. In its preamble, and in Part II and III, the Constitution clearly spelt out the type of society that was the dream of the framers and the leaders of the independence movement. The preamble declared that it shall be a fundamental aim of the State to realise through the democratic process a socialist society, free from exploitation a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens.

41. Article 7 says, "The Constitution is the Supreme law of the Republic and if any law is inconsistent with the Constitution, the other law, shall to the extent of the inconsistency, be void." Article 11 provides that the Republic shall be a democracy in which fundamental human rights and freedoms and respect for the dignity and worth of human person shall be guaranteed. Further, our Constitution in Article 27 in clear and unambiguous terms provides that All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. Article 26 reads: All existing law inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, become void on the commencement of this Constitution.

42. Constitution not only guarantees equality of all citizens irrespective of sex, religion etc, but also provides for special arrangements for the backward classes. Article 28 provides: (1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only on religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth: (2) Women shall have equal rights with men in all spheres of the State and of public life; (3) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth be subjected to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to access to any place of public entertainment or resort, or admission to any educational institution. (4) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making special provision in favour of women or children or for the advancement of any backward section of citizens.

43. Article 31 guarantees treatment in accordance with law, right to PRIVACY etc. It reads:

“....... To enjoy the protection of the law, and to be treated in accordance with law, and only in accordance with law, is the inalienable right of every citizen , wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time being within Bangladesh, and in particular no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law ..........”
44. Now we should be looking into the international obligations of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh vis-à-vis gender equality, equal protection of law, non-discriminatory treatment towards women members of the Republic. Bangladesh ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1984 and has submitted seven progress reports on its implementation and participated in meetings of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (herein after the Committee).

45. The Eighth Periodic Report of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Submitted Under Article 18 in 2015 contains, inter cilia:

‘....... 34. In addition to legal measures to maintain equality, equal protection of law; and non discrimination, institutions and measures are in place as follows:

35. National Council for Women and Children Development (NCWCD): National Council for Women Development (NCWD), chaired by the Honorable Prime Minister and consisting of representatives of government, civil society, and women's organizations was merged in 2009 with the National Council for Child Development (NCCD) and was named the National Council for Women and Children Development (NCWCD). The NCWCD provides policy guidance and monitors the implementation of critical policy decisions on women's and children's development.

36. Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MOWCA): MOWCA is the nodal ministry for gender governance and acts as the lead ministry in promoting gender equality. MOWCA coordinates the response by all government agencies to the needs and priorities of women and implements policies and programme& through its three agencies, Department of Women Affairs (DWA), Jatiya Mohila Shangstha (JMS) and Bangladesh Shishu Academy (BSA). A Policy Leadership and Advocacy Unit (PLAU) provides technical support to MOWCA in coordinating women's advancement activities within the Government. The Annex D shows the existing institutional mechanism.

37. Other mechanisms: Other institutional mechanisms such as Parliamentary Standing Committee for MOWCA and Women In Development Focal Point (WIDFP), WIDFP Implementation and Evaluation Committee (WIDFPIEC), Women In Development Focal Point Coordination Committee (WIDFPCC) and Women In Development Focal Point Network Committee (WIDFPNC) are in place. The WIDFPs of all ministries lead to address gender concerns within the policies and plans of their respective ministries.

38. Development Plans: Equality is promoted through implementation of development plans. The Perspective Plan (2010-2021) provides framework for the implementation of the Government's Vision 2021....”

46. In that premises, we are of the view that the Government is pledge bound to and under an obligation to protect the rights of women and to ensure gender equality in all spheres of the Republic.

47. The content and ambit of the great equalising principle enunciated in article 27 is wide. There can be no doubt that it is a founding faith of the Constitution, our apex Court in several decisions have held that it is the pillar on which rests securely the foundation of our democratic Republic. It was held in Shayara Bano vs Union of India reported in (2017) 9 SCC 1 that Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits.

48. We coincide with what was pointed out by the majority in EP Royappa vs State of TN reported in (1974) 4 SCC 3:

‘........... From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14....'

49. Nariman, J holds in Shayara Banos case Article 14 (our article 27) strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article 14. It must be "right and just and fair" and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive; otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied."

50. We are of the view that the fundamental right to equality guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution, manifested within its fold equality of status. Gender equality, gender equity and gender justice are values intrinsically entwined in the guarantee of equality under the Constitutional realm, the rights of a Muslim women to human dignity, social esteem and self-worth are vital facets of a woman's right to life with dignity, under Articles 27, 28, 31 and 32 of the Constitution. It was submitted that gender justice was a constitutional goal of overwhelming importance and magnitude, without accomplishing the same, half of the country's citizenry, would not able to enjoy to the fullest—their rights, status and opportunities. That gender equality and the dignity of women are non-negotiable, they are necessary not only to realise the aspirations of every individual woman, who is an equal citizen of this country, but also, for the larger well-being of society and the progress of the nation, one-half of which is made up by women. The basic structure permeates equality of status and opportunity. Personal laws are derived not from the Constitution but from the religious scriptures. Human rights and fundamental freedom have been reiterated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and have mutual reinforcement. It was held in the Triple Talaq Case (mentioned above): the human rights for women, including girl child are, therefore, inalienable, integral and 'indivisible part of universal human rights. The full development of personality and fundamental freedoms and equal participation by women in political, social, economic and cultural life are concomitants for national development, social and family stability and growth, culturally, socially and economically. All forms of discrimination on grounds of gender is violative of fundamental freedoms and human rights." We take the view that Articles 26, 27, 28, 31 are inseparable part of the basic structure of the Constitution. These values the right to equality, non-discrimination and the right to live life with dignity forms (he bedrock of the Constitution. Furthermore, gender equality and dignity for women is an inalienable and inseparable part of the basic structure of the Constitution, the most fundamental facet of equality under the Constitution was gender equality and gender equity. Thus we do not find any difficulty in striking out the impugned entry from the impugned kabinnama.

51. The next issue we like to deal with is PRIVACY. Although the word has not been used in our Constitution as it is, it is implied in the words and phrases of Articles 11 and 32 as dignity, reputation and privacy are part and parcel of right to life. It was held in Govind vs State, reported in AIR 1975 SC 1378:

‘.......... The right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through a process of cast by case development. Therefore, even assuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and freedom of speech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation from them which one can characterize as a fundamental right we do not think that the right is absolute a right to privacy is itself a fundamental right...'

52. Similarly in Mr 'X' vs Hospital 'Z', reported in AIR 1999 SC 495, it was held:‘......... Right of privacy may apart from contract, also arise out of a particular specific relationship which may be commercial, matrimonial, or even political. As already discussed above. Doctor-patient relationship, though basically commercial, is professionally, a matter of confidence and therefore, Doctors are morally and ethically bound to maintain confidentiality. In such a situation, public disclosure of even true private facts may amount to an invasion of the Right of Privacy which may sometimes lead to the clash of one person's right to be let alone" with another person. Disclosure of even true private facts has the tendency to disturb a person's tranquility. It may generate many complexes in him and may even lead to psychological problems. He may thereafter, have disturbed life all through. In the face of these potentialities and as already held by this Court in its various decisions referred to above. The Right of Privacy is an essential component of right to life envisaged by Article 21. The right however is no absolute and may be lawfully restricted for the prevention of crime, disorder or protection of health or morals or protection of rights and freedom of others...'

53. It was held in R. Rajagopal vs State of TN reported in AIR 1995 SC 264 :

‘.......... The right to privacy as an independent and distinctive concept originated in the field of Tort Law, under which a new cause of action for damages resulting from unlawful invasion of privacy was recognized. This right has two aspects which are but two faces of the same coin: (1) the general law of privacy which affords a tort action for damages resulting from an unlawful invasion of privacy and (2) the constitutional recognition given to the right to privacy which protects personal privacy against unlawful governmental invasion. In recent times, however, this right has acquired a constitutional status ..........’

54. In a recent judgment of one of this Court's Division Bench [6 CLR (HCD) (2018) Nurjahan Ruzi vs Bangladesh (per Mr Syed Refaat Ahmed, J)] the issue of right to privacy has been discussed. The Court held :

‘......... It is this Court's finding that such balance was indeed not struck in the facts by the Respondent No.6 and this stemmed from not only a misconceived requirement of disclosure of personal status by the applicant-Petitioner but also a misdirected inquiry into the primacy of her marital status in the facts. It is here that this Court finds that the requirement under the law is of a disclosure of marital status current and extant-as-evident from an existing sate of wedlock at the material time i.e., on the date of submission of the application of External Cadet Sub-Inspector It appears to this Court that the Respondents have veered towards an unauthorized scrutiny on that latter circumstance, thereby, unduly, unreasonably and unfairly burdening the petitioner with an obligation of disclosure not sanctioned or required in law.'

55. As we note from the submission made by the learned Counsel Mr Hossain, dignity and privacy are important values promoted by Islamic faith. It was submitted : ‘....... It is the girl's right to make a decision concerning her marriage, and her father or guardian is not permitted to override her objections or ignore her wishes. Prying into other peoples' private affairs and spying on their secrets is not permitted, even if they are engaged in sin, as long as long as they do it privately and not openly. Uqbah then said, 'Woe to you! Do not do that, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him) say, If one conceals the private affairs (of others), it is like reviving a girl who has been buried alive from her grave. [The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam By Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi at pages 314-316, 321-322] . The Islamic jurist further writes : During the Farewell pilgrimage the Prophet (peace be on him) addressed the asembly of Muslims, saying, Your lives, your honour, and your property are as sacred to each other as the sacredness of this your day, in this your month, and in this your city.

56. The impugned forms at clause No. 5 require the bride to make a statement as to her marital status and her sexual history, specifically stating whether she is virgin/widowed/divorced should be re-phrased for the sake of removal of the degrading and discriminatory entries. The forms at clause Nos.21 and 22 respectively, only require the groom to make a statement regarding a subsisting marriage, but do not require any statement as to whether he is a widower/ divorced /previously married or is a Celibate. It is discriminating and arbitrary and created inequality violating the said provisions of the Constitution, negating the CEDAW obligations. Such requirements are violative of fundamental rights, in particular the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sex, the right to be treated in accordance with law, as guaranteed under Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution. Interference with such privacy also violates a women's right to personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 31 and 32 of the constitution. Inclusion of the Word "Kumari" instead of "Unmarried" is humiliating and degrading to the woman's personhood and dignity as protected by Articles 32 of the Constitution and contradicts with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) inasmuch as it has the effect of discrimination against woman on the basis of sex, also impairing the dignity of woman by invading upon their privacy.

57. However, since the Government vide SRO No. 84-Ain/2011 dated 10th April, 2011 inserted the following to the impugned kabinnama forms, the other terms of the Rule (with respect to the identities of the parties to a marriage etc.) are not required to be dealt with:

"৩। [জন্ম নিবন্ধন সনদ/জাতীয় পরিচয়পত্র/জুনিয়র স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (জে.এস.সি) বা মাধ্যমিক স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (এস.এস.সি) বা সমমানের পরীক্ষার সনদপত্র/মাতা, পিতা বা আইনগত অভিভাবক প্রদত্ত বয়স সংক্রান্ত হলফনামা অনুযায়ী বরের বয়স...............
৬। [জন্ম নিবন্ধন সনদ/জাতীয় পরিচয়পত্র/জুনিয়র স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (জে.এস.সি) বা মাধ্যমিক স্কুল সার্টিফিকেট (এস.এস.সি) বা সমমানের পরীক্ষার সনদপত্র/মাতা, পিতা বা আইনগত অভিভাবক প্রদত্ত বয়স সংক্রান্ত হলফনামা অনুযায়ী কনার বয়স............"
This Court's declaration:

58. In view of the position expressed above, we are satisfied that this is a case which presents a situation where this Court should exercise its discretion to issue appropriate directions under Article-102 of the Constitution.

Thus the entry No. 5 in Forms No. 1601 is hereby declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect being discriminatory against women on the ground of sex and marital status in violation of Articles 28, 31 and 32 of the Constitution; The Respondents are hereby directed to take necessary action (preferably within a period of 6 (six) months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment) :

(i)to amend the entry No.5 in Bangladesh Forms No. 1601 (ফরম-খ) (Form-Kha) (kabinnama) appended to the Rules, by omitting the word "Kumari" in respect of brides, and be replaced with the following:

"5. Marital Status of the Bride: [Unmarried/ Divorced/Widow?
...... [In Bangla: কন্যা অবিবাহিতা বিধবা অথবা তালাকপ্রাপ্তা নারী কিনা]

to insert the following in the said forms: "21. Marital Status of the Bridegroom: [Married/Unmarried/Divorced/Widower?] In Bangla : বর বিবাহিত/অবিবাহিত/তালাকপ্রাপ্ত/বিপত্নীক কিনা in the beginning of entry No. 21 keeping the existing sentence intact.

59. With these observations and directions, the Rule is disposed of.

60. The office is directed to communicate the order at once.

61. No order as to costs.

Khizir Ahmed Choudhury, J:

I have gone through the judgment authored by my lord Ms. Justice Naima Haider and I fully agree with the findings and ultimate result of the instant Rule but I would like to dwell some aspects which has bearing in the instant Rule.

63. In Form having framed under "Muslim Marriage and Talak Registration Rules 2009", some discriminatory remarks has been inserted in clause 5 which militates with clause 21 of the said form having clearly dealt in the findings of the judgment. Article 26 of the constitution of the People Republic of Bangladesh also clearly prohibits from making any law inconsistent with any provisions of the part 111 titled as "fundamental rights" which runs as follows:

1. All existing law inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, become void on the commencement of this Constitution.

2. The state shall not make any law inconsistent with any provisions of this Part, and any law so made shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.

3. ...........

64. As per Article 152 of the Constitution "Muslim Marriage and Talak registration rules 2009" is also law and, as such, remarks made in column 5 of form "Gha" to the effect that "কন্যা কুমারী" being discriminatory cannot be sustained.

65. Apart from this Article 27 also stipulates that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. Article 28 also postulates that the state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth and also stipulates that woman shall have equal rights with men in all spheres of the state and public life. Equally, Article 31 mandates that all citizens will enjoy protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law and only in accordance with law.

66. Another important aspect is that under Mohammadan law Muslim Marriage is a contract and it is necessary that the men or someone on his behalf and the women or someone on her behalf should agree to the marriage at one meeting and the said agreement should be witnessed by two adult witnesses. It can be termed a Civil contract but with passage of time and changed circumstances registration of marriages has became necessary and consequently in our country "the Muslim Marriage and divorce Registration Act 1974" has been enacted wherein section 3 of the said act finds provision for registration of marriages and also Nikah Registers are entrusted for registration of marriages and divorces. Consequent to the said act successive rules have been framed under which marriage and divorce are registered under specific forms and presently it is being done under " ফরম ‘ঘ’ মুসলিম বিবাহ ও তালাক (নিবন্ধন) বিধিমালা, ২০০৯ এর বিধি ২৮(১) (ক) অনুযায়ী বিবাহ রেজিস্টারী বহি”, So as the terms referred to in the said form Gha namely "কন্যা কুমারী" is not mandate of Muslim law, it should be deleted for harmonizing the status of bride and bride groom.

Consequently, from all perimeters it is amply clear that remarks made in clause 5 in form “ঘ” namely "কন্যা কুমারী " is clearly discriminatory and against the avowed spirit of our constitution and, as such, this inconsistent remark requires to be deleted.

End.

Though the petitioner tried to sit with them in Cox's Bazar Bar Association in several times but in vain. That the petitioner finding no other way cancelled the Irrevocable Power of Attorney on 11-9-2009 vide registered deed No. 25-12-2007. That the petitioner filed Mutation Case No. 1205 of 2006 and mutated his name in the B S. Khatian No. 4706 and the petitioner has been paying rents to the concerned authority regularly. That the petitioner filed an application to the respondents for permission to sell the allotted plot, against the said application to the Ministry of Housing and Public Works and the ministry issued a letter to the Executive Engineer, Cox's Bazar vide Memo No. sha-9/1- M- 26/2008/302 dated 7-5-2008 to send elaborate report regarding the ownership of the land.

That on 20-1-2016 the petitioner sent a Notice Demanding Justice through registered post with acknowledgement document and by special messenger to the respondents No.1-3 and prayed that the respondents permit the petitioner to sell the schedule property. That the respondent No. 3 issued a letter vide memo No. Shakha-9/1M-26/2008/38 dated 21-1-2016 to the petitioner denying to permit to transfer the schedule land with a malafide and arbitrary intention. That the said letter is impugned herein. Hence the writ petition.

6. Learned Advocate Mr Mr Sherder Abul Hossain, Advocate with Mr Md Ashraful Islam, Advocate with Mr Tanjil Mahmud, Advocate appeared for the petitioner while learned DAG Mr Noor Us Sadik Chowdhury along with Mr Prahlad Debnath AAG along with Mr Md Hafizur Rahman, AAG along with Ms. Farida Parvin Flora, AAG appeared for the respondent Nos. 1-7 and learned Advocate Mr Md Musharraf Hossain Mozumder appeared for the respondent No.9 .

7. Learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the final refusal in not allowing him to transfer the property vide memo no. Shakha-9/1M-26/2008/38, dated 21-1-2016 which is Annexure -H issued by the respondent No. 3 is without lawful authority and not sustainable. He agitates that the respondent No. 3 by his order dated 21-1-2016 refusing to allow the petitioner to transfer the property is arbitrary and is a slip shod order. He draws attention to Annexurer H and submits that the respondent No. 3 did not anywhere mention in his order their reason for not allowing the petitioner to transfer his property. He contends that admittedly the petitioner is still a lessee having being allotted the land in 1980 and has been continuing as a lawful lessee since over a period of 40 years. Upon a query from the bench regarding the respondent's contention as to some pending suits between the instant petitioner and some other individuals (persons), the learned Advocate for the petitioner agitated that whatever suit/case may be pending between the petitioner and some other individual/person do not concern the respondent Nos. 1-7 at all. He argues that such pending suit involve issues which are disputed matter of fact to be decided in the concerned civil court. He agitates that so far the respondents are concerned admittedly the petitioner still a lessee and the land is duly mutated in his name upon payment of rent, taxes, DCR etc. and which is clear from Annexure E of the writ petition. He draws attention to Annexure E which is an enquiry conducted by the respondents. He contends that nowhere in the enquiry report is there any negative indication or remark on any malafide nor any latches on the part of the petitioner. He continues that from the enquiry report it is clear that the property pursuant to allotment was duly mutated in the petitioners name followed by payment of rent, taxes, DCR etc in the name of petitioner who is the lawful and admitted lessee.

8. Upon another query from this bench regarding the respondent's contention that clauses 19 and 17 of the Lease Deed dated 27-12-1980 was not complied with, he argues that nowhere in the enquiry report nor by way of any other evidences could it shown be that clauses 19 and 17 was not complied with.

9. Regarding the issue of power of attorney granted by the petitioner to some other person subsequent to allotment, the learned Advocate for the petitioner strenuously argued that Power of Attorney is a legal right and which does not require any permission from the respondents. He submits that subsequent to any allotment of property power of attorney can be lawfully granted to any person for sake of convenience whatsoever for purpose of construction of building or any other reason. He reiterates that since after 40 years of the original allotment admittedly the petitioner is still a lawful lessee therefore the respondents have no legal right in not allowing him to transfer the property moreover without assigning any valid reason. He further submits that the allotment has not been cancelled and which is contemplated in clause 22 of the lease deed in the event of any default by the petitioner. He continues that therefore it is evident that the petitioner pursuant to the allotment by granting another person power by way of power of attorney to construct building on his behalf whatsoever, however did not deviate or otherwise depart from the terms of the deed. He submits that since the allotment has not been terminated therefore it is to be presumed that clauses 19 and 20 and also 22 of the lease deed was complied with. He argued that therefore it is the lawful right of the petitioner to obtain permission from the Respondents. He agitates that the respondent no. 3 without assigning any reason by way of slip shod order arbitrarily and whimisically refused the petitioner. He concludes his submission upon assertion that the Rule bears merit ought to be made absolute for ends of justice.

10. On the other hand, learned AAG Mr Prahlad Devnath appearing for the respondent No. 1-7 by way of filing affidavit in opposition opposes the Rule. From the affidavit in opposition he however mainly submits on some factual matters pertaining to some suits pending between the petitioner and some other individuals/persons. He submits that since some suits are pending between the petitioner and some others therefore pending the suit the respondents are not in a position to transfer the land. He further submits that the petitioners did not comply with some relevant clauses of the lease deed which stipulate a time of 2(two) years from the date of allotment to construct on the leased land and therefore the petitioner may not be allowed to lawfully transfer the property. He further submits that the petitioner did not act lawfully since he granted power of attorney to some other person after allotment of the property and further there are some pending suits between the petitioner and some other persons in the lower court. He made some other factual submissions regarding the reason of the respondents refusal not to allow the petitioner to transfer the land. Upon a query from this bench as to whether the respondents still acknowledge the petitioner as their lessee? the learned Assistant Attorney-General however concedes and admits that the petitioner is still a lessee of the government(Respondents). He concludes his submission upon assertion that however the Rule bears no merits ought to be discharged for ends of justice.

11. The learned Advocate for the respondent No. 9 who is the purchaser of the property from the petitioner substantively support the contention of the learned Advocate for the Respondents and concludes his submission upon assertion that the Rule bears no merit and ought to be made Absolute for ends of justice.

12. We have heard the learned Advocates for all sides, perused the application and materials on records. It is an admitted fact by both the parties that whatever the reason of refusal to transfer may be however the petitioner is still a lessee of the government since 1980.

13. For purpose of proper disposal of the Rule we have examined the lease deed which has been annexed as Annexure-A and which is dated 20-10-1980. For our purpose we have examined Clauses 3, 19, 20 and 22 of the lease deed. Clauses 3, 19, 20 and 22 of the lease deed reproduced hereunder:

"(3) That the constructions to be made on the demised property shall not cover more than two-thirds of the demised property and within two years from the date of commencement of the lease or within such further time as the Lessor may allow in his discretion, the tenant shall complete the building on the demised property of a house with all necessary outhouses, boundary marks , drains and appurtenance for the purpose of a residence including a septic tank of a pattern approved by the Chief Engineer, Public Works Department."

"(19) That the tenant shall not sell, charge, mortgage, exchange, gift away otherwise assign, sublet, encumber or in any way part with or dispose of the demise property or any part thereof before the construction of the buildings, outhouses and appurtenances hereby covenanted to be erected."

"(20) That subject to the provision of clause 19, the tenant shall be at liberty to transfer or sublet subject to the conditions of these presents the whole of the demised property subject to the obligation that the transfer shall be registered in the office of such authority as may be appointed by the lessor, and unless this is done the lessor will not be bound to recognise or accept any person as tenant of the demised property in place of the transferor."
14. Clause 3 of the lease deed contemplate that the property pursuant to being allotted t42 the lessee the lessee must construct on at least /3rd within a period of 2(two) years. Clause 19 and 20 of the lease deed also consist of similar provision. Clause 19 of the lease deed contemplate that in the absence of constructing house in the property the petitioner shall not have any right to transfer the property. Clause 20 of the lease deed however contemplate that subject to construction by way of building etc. in the land the lessee (tenant) shall be at liberty to transfer or sublet the property in whole or in part thereof whatsoever and in the case of transfer, the property shall be duly registered. It also contemplates that in the absence of registration the lessor shall not be bound to acknowledge the new transferee or new lessee whatsoever.

15. We have particularly perused clause 22 of the lease deed which contemplates that in case of failure to construct building within the stipulated time of 2(two) years, if any lessee fails to perform his part within that time the respondents shall be at liberty to terminate the lease and following such termination shall proceed accordingly with the relevant laws.

16. Now as mentioned above in this case the petitioner admittedly is still a lessee and which is conceded and admitted by the respondent government. In our considered opinion since the petitioner is admittedly still a lessee since 1980 and since his allotment has not yet been cancelled therefore it may be presumed and concluded that the petitioner did not deviate from the prescribed clause. We may safely presume that the petitioner followed the conditions in clause Nos. 3, 4, 19, 20 and other relevant clauses of the lease deed. It is only reasonable and logical to hold that if the petitioner was not in compliance with the conditions and terms of the lease deed, the lease deed would have been terminated by dint of clause 4 of the lease deed. But however the petitioner in this case is till date a lawful and legal lessee as admitted by the respondents.

17. Truly enough permission is required in accordance with the lease deed and under the other relevant laws. Before transferring any property the lessee is required to obtain permission from the concerned authority. However it must be borne in mind that refusing to allow transfer a property cannot be done arbitrarily and particularly in this case the petitioner has been an allottee since 1980 and a lawful lessee. While his refusing to be allowed permission to transfer his property the respondents must assign a cogent reason. In this case it is clear by way of Annexure-H dated 21-1-2016 that the respondents did not assign any reason. The order dated 21-1-2016 which is annexure-H denying the petitioner to allow him to transfer is a slip shod order with no explanation at all. Further we have examined the enquiry report (Annexure E). Upon careful examination of the findings of the enquiry report dated 21-8-2008 we do not find any negative comment against the present petitioner. It appears that the enquiry report expressly stated that pursuant to the allotment the lessee (petitioner here) have been paying taxes, DCR etc.

18. As to the power of Attorney being granted to some other person it is common knowledge that a power of attorney is a common factor and is often granted by the owner to some other person to construct/ sell or otherwise supervise the property for sake of convenience. We do not find anywhere anything in any other law which may indicate that permission is required from the respondents/authorities to grant power of attorney. Apparently the enquiry report found that there is a construction building also thereupon in the demised land. Therefore it may be safely concluded that the petitioner complied with the conditions/terms of the lease deed. Since the lease is still continuing and has not been cancelled therefore it is evident that the petitioners complied with the rules and conditions.

19. The learned AAG on behalf of the respondents agitated that there are some pending suits between the petitioner and some other person and for that reason transfer of the property to any other person is not possible.

20. It is a settled principle of law that property may be transferred by any person/ lessee/owner whatsoever to some other person even pending a suit. However it is also a settled principle of law that if there are any pending cases involved in that event the purchaser shall purchase or otherwise obtain the property from the transferor with all its rights and liabilities attached to such property whatsoever. Therefore the transferor may purchase the property and shall be transposed in the possession of the original lessee and he shall purchase the property pending any suit and the fate of the original suit shall decide the fate of the subsequent transferee of the property. Therefore the purchaser shall purchase the property bearing in mind that the fate of the property shall be decided depending on the fate of the suit.

21. From the foregoing discussions made above and under the facts and circumstances we are of the considered view that we do not see any legal bar nor any other bar as to why the petitioner cannot transfer the property to any other person. The respondent No. 3 by his slip shod order dated 21-1-2016 which is annexed as Annexure-H in the writ petition committed illegality in not allowing the petitioner to transfer the Plot No.50, Block-A, measuring an area of 5 Kathas of Mouza Jhilongjha, Upazila-Cox's Bazar, Cox's Bazar Sea Beach Area. He gave a slip shod and non speaking order. We find merit in this Rule.

22. In the result, the Rule is made absolute with direction and relying on the observations made above. The impugned letter vide Memo No. Shakha-9/IM-26/2008/38 dated 21-1-2016 issued by the respondent No. 3 which is marked as Annexure-H in the writ petition is hereby declared without lawful authority and if of no legal effect. The respondent Nos. 1-7 are hereby directed to permit the petitioner to transfer the Plot No. 50 , Block-A, Measuring an area of 5 Kathas of Mouza Jhilongjhc Upazila-Cox's Bazar, Cox's Bazar Sea Beach Area within a period of 90(ninety) days from the date of receiving of this judgment. Communicate this judgment at once.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF BANGLADESH

High Court Division

(Civil Miscellaneous Jurisdiction)

First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 33 of 2021
With
Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020

City Bank Limited, represented by its Managing Director (Appellant)
VS
SM Delwar Hossain (Respondent)

Present:
Mr. Justice Md. Rezaul Hasan

Judgment Date: September 27, 2021

Md Sameer Sattar, Advocate For the Appellant.

Md Akteruzzaman, Advocate For the Respondent.
JUDGMENT
Md Rezaul Hasan, J: This appeal is directed against the impugned judgment and order No. 34 dated 22-1-2017, passed by the Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Bogura, in Miscellaneous Review Case No. 02 of 2014 (arising out of Civil Revision No.24 of 2013) allowing the Review and, thereby, giving effect to the order No.13 dated 21-1-2013, passed by the Senior Assistant Judge, 1st Court, Bogura, in Civil Suit No.390 of 2011.

2. Facts, relevant for disposal of this First Miscellaneous Appeal, in brief, are that, one SM Delowar Hossain filed Civil Suit No.390 of 2011 before the court of 1st Assistant Judge, Bogura, against the Managing Director, City Bank Limited and 3 others, praying for declaration that the termination order dated 14-7-2011, whereby the services of the plaintiff has been ended, is illegal, collusive, without jurisdiction, void, malafide, ineffective and not binding upon him. The plaintiff has also prayed for direction for payment of his salary as well as other reliefs, which he may be entitled to as per law. The case of the plaintiff is that, he was appointed as "Cash Sorter" on 27-9-1990, on probation, and thereafter his service was confirmed on 4-5-1991. Subsequently, the Bank has promoted him to the post of Senior Cash Officer. Later on, he was transferred to Bogura Branch against the post of "Chief Retailer". His further case is that, he has rendered his services with the satisfaction of the superior authority and has been enjoying his salary and other benefits accordingly. But, on 13-7-2011, when the plaintiff went to join his duty at Bogura Branch, he was prevented from joining and was asked to go to the Head Office. He then went to the Head Office of the Bank. But, Mr Jabed Amin and Head of Policy Ms. Khil Khil Newa detained him and compelled him to submit a resignation letter. Further case of the plaintiff is that, he lodged a GD entry on 23-7-2011, wherein he has stated all these facts and he was removed from the services in the name of termination, most arbitrarily and inhumanly and without issuing any prior notice. In these circumstances, causes of action has arisen and he was compelled to file this suit.

3. The defendants contested in the suit by filing written statement, on 26-11-2012, in which, they have denied all allegations made in the plaint and stated their own case at paragraph No. 10 of the written statements. The defence case, in brief, is that, the Bank is a juristic person and that it has a Service Rule applicable to the bank employees. According to that Service Rule, the Bank can terminate the services of any employee, including the plaintiff, as per clause 9.2.3, which is the privilege of the employer. Further case of the defendant was that, the plaintiff was not dismissed from his services and he was paid 3(three) month's salary, in lieu of 3(three) months notice period and was given other benefits as were admissible as per law. Accordingly, the plaintiff has no case, nor any cause of action to file this suit and he is not entitled to get any relief as prayed for.

4. Along with the written statement, the defendants have filed an application under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, (Annexure-D) for rejection of the plaint alleging that, the plaintiff has been terminated as per the Service Rules of the bank and he was given all service benefits as per the Service Rules and that it was a termination simpliciter. Therefore, the plaint is liable to be rejected.

5. The trial court heard the parties on this application for rejection of the plaint. It was of the opinion that, the plaintiff has served in the Bank for long period and there was no adverse remarks on his service report. The trial court has also recorded that no notice was served upon the plaintiff, nor he was given any opportunity to show cause. On these findings, the trial court had rejected the application for rejection of the plaint, vide its judgment and order dated 21-1-2013.

6. Against the said judgment and order of the trial court, the Bank preferred Civil Revision No. 24 of 2013, before the District Judge, Bogura. Being transferred, the Civil Revision No. 24 of 2013 was heard by the Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Bogura, who, in presence of both the parties, had allowed the civil revision by its judgment and order dated 23-3-2014, on contest, and had set-aside the judgment and order of the trial court dated 21-1-2013. Against the said order of the lower revisional court, the plaintiff has filed Miscellaneous Review Case No. 2 of 2014 before the same court (Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Bogura). The lower revisional court, after hearing the review petition, vide it's judgment and order dated 22-1-2017, has allowed the application for review, set-aside the judgment and order dated 21-1-2013, passed revision, and upheld the judgment and order dated 21-3-2013 of the trial court.

7. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order of the revisional court dated 22-1-2017, the Bank has filed this application under section 115(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which was subsequently converted into First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 33 of 2021 by an order dated 4-12-2019, whereupon the Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020 has been issued.

8. Both the First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 33 of 2021 and Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020 have been taken up for analogous hearing and disposal.

9. Learned Advocate Mr Sameer Satter appeared for the defendant-appellant. He, having placed the Memo of Appeal alongwith other documents annexed thereto, 1st of all submits that, a mere perusal of the termination letter will show that, this was termination simpliciter and the plaintiff was given service benefit in lieu of 90 days notice period as well as other benefits admissible in This case. He also submits that, termination of service is a privilege of the employer and this is permitted by Clause No. 9.2.3 of the Service Rules of the Bank. He next submits that, this suit filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable and if a terminated employee is allowed to file a suit then it will open a flood-gate to file several cases, while termination is a mode recognized to relieve on from his job. He also submits that, the trial court has utterly failed to understand the legal aspect of this case and it had erroneously passed the order dated 21-1-2013. He also submits that, no stigma or any kind of blame has been imposed upon the plaintiff. Therefore, he continues, the plaintiff had no cause of action, moreso when he has been paid all his service benefit as per Rules and Regulations of the Bank. He next submits that, the revisional court has discussed the case of both the parties as well as it had considered the decisions cited before it and had arrived at a correct judgment and order dated 23-3-2014. But, the learned Advocate submits that, the revisional court ought not to have admitted the Review Case No. 02 of 2014 in as much as the condition laid down in Order 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for entertaining an application for review, did not exist in this case. Moreover, the said Review Petition No. 02 of 2014 has not been filed upon any of the grounds enumerated in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and, therefore, the revisional court, in admitting the Review Petition No.02 of 2014, has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it and the impugned judgment and order dated 22-10-2017, whereby it has set-aside it's own judgment and order dated 23-3-2014 passed in Civil Revision No.24 of 2013. He next submits that, once the revisional court has passed the order dated 24-10-2013 it has become functus-officio. Therefore, the learned Advocate submits that, in passing the impugned judgment and order dated 22-1-2017, passed in Review Petition No. 02 of 2014, the lower revisional court has committed grave error of law, that has resulted in error in the decision passed as well as it has occasioned in a serious failure of justice. Moreover, it has created a bad precedence by setting aside it's own order in purported exercise of the review jurisdiction when none of the grounds were available. He concludes that, this appeal has merit and the same may kindly be allowed.

10. Learned Advocate Mr Md Akter-uz-zaman has appeared on behalf of the respondent-opposite party. He, on the other hand, submits that, the trial court has rightly passed the judgment and order dated 21-1-2013, whereby it has rejected the application for rejection of the plaint. He next submits that, the order dated 21-1-2013 of the trial court is a speaking order and the plaintiff served in the Bank for a long period and there is no earthly reason to terminate his service and his termination is not in the interest of the Bank. He next submits that, the revisional court, vide it's judgment and order dated 23-3-2014, passed in Civil Revision No. 24 of 2013, although set-aside the order of the trial court in Review Petition No. 02 of 2014, it has reassessed the entire case of the parties and has rightly allowed the review application on contest and thereby it has secured the ends of justice. As such, the impugned judgment and order passed by the court below, in exercise of it's review jurisdiction, do not call for any interference by this Court. He next submits that, the plaintiff is an officer of the Bank and was promoted to the higher post because of his meritorious career and an employee cannot be left to the caprices of the Bank Management. Moreover, the learned Advocate proceeds on that, the Bank has not given any release letter to the plaintiff which shows a clear case of malafide exercise of the power. He next submits that, the defendants have violated the direction given in the BRPD Circular Letter No. 07 dated 28th May, 2015, issued by Bangladesh Bank. Besides, he further submits that, the defendants have denied to the plaintiff the opportunity to re-pay the house loan by installments to be deducted from his salary during continuation of his service and has denied to him his livelihood. He concludes that, this appeal has no merit and the same is liable to be dismissed and the Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2021 may kindly be discharged.

11. I have heard the learned Advocates appearing for both the parties, perused the Memo of Appeal, application for stay and the documents annexed to the petition and other materials on record.

12. I find from the termination letter that it is apparently a termination simpliciter and the plaintiff was given service benefit in lieu of 90 days notice period.

13. In the light of the facts and circumstances of this case, as revealed from the pleadings of the parties and the materials available in the record, I have taken into consideration the BRPD Circular Letter No. 07 dated 28th May, 2015, that reads as follows:

"ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক/প্রধান নির্বাহী, বাংলাদেশ কার্যরত সব তফসিলী ব্যাংক।
প্রিয় মহোদয়,
ব্যাংকে পরিপালনের জন্য কতিপয় নির্দেশনা প্রসঙ্গে।
সাম্প্রতিককালে লক্ষ্য করা যাচ্ছে যে, ব্যাকিং সময়সূচীর পরে কার্যদিবস শেষে কর্মকর্তা-কর্মচারী বিশেষ করে মহিলা কর্মকর্তা/কির্মচারীদেরকে ব্যাংকে অবস্থানের জন্য বাধ্য করা হচ্ছে। তাছাড়া, তফসিলী ব্যাংকের কর্মকর্তাগণের নিকট হতে চাকুরীতে ইস্তফা, অযৌক্তিক বরখাস্তকরণ কিংবা অপসারণ এবং পরবর্তী আর্থিক সুবিধা প্রাপ্তিতে হয়রানিসহ বিভিন্ন বিষয়ে অসংখ্য অভিযোগ উত্থাপিত হচ্ছে। ফলে বিভিন্ন রকমের জটিলতার উত্তব হচ্ছে বা সুষ্ঠু মানব সম্পদ ব্যবস্থাপনার ক্ষেত্রে অন্তরায়।
এতদসূত্রে ব্যাংক কর্তৃক পরিচালিত বিভিন্ন নিয়মাচার পর্যালোচনান্তে এ মর্মে সিদ্ধান্ত গৃহীত হয়েছে যে, ব্যাংকিং সময়সূচীর পরে অর্থাৎ সন্ধ্যা ৬.০০ ঘটিকায় কার্যদিবস শেষে ব্যাংকে অবস্থানের জন্য বাধ্য করা যাবে না। বিশেষ অফিসীয় প্রয়োজনে যদি কোন মহিলা কর্মকর্তা/কর্মচারীদেরকে ব্যাংকিং সময়সূচীর পরেও ব্যাংকে অবস্থান করতে হয় তবে তাদেরকে উপযুক্ত নিরাপত্তা ও পারিশ্রমিক প্রদান করতে হবে।
আরো উল্লেখ্য, ব্যাংক কর্তৃক ইচ্ছামাফিক ঢালাওভাবে কর্মকর্তা/কির্মচারী ছাটাই রদ করতে হবে। নিয়োগকালে পেশাদারিত্বের সাথে প্রার্থী যাচাই-বাছাই করতে হবে। নিয়োগকৃত কর্মকর্তা/কর্মচারীদেরকে প্রয়োজনীয় প্রশিক্ষণের মাধ্যমে উপযুক্ত করে গড়ে তুলতে হবে। এছাড়া, ব্যাংকের কর্মকর্তাগণের চাকুরীতে ইস্তফা, চাকুরী হতে বরখাস্তকরণ কিংবা অপসারণ এবং পরবর্তী আর্থিক সুবিধা প্রাপ্তির ক্ষেত্র International Labour Organazation Conventions, বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ ও সময়ে সময়ে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক প্রদত্ত নির্দেশনার যথাযথ প্রতিফলন ঘটিয়ে ব্যাংকের সার্ভিস রুলস সংশোধন করতঃ তার যথাযথ পরিপালন নিশ্চিত করতে হবে।
এ নির্দেশ অবিলম্বে কার্যকর হবে।"
14. This BRPD Circular Letter No. 07 dated 28th May, 2015, has been issued by the Bangladesh Bank in exercise of the powers vested in it, by clause (Ka) and (Gha) of sub-section (1) of section 45 of the Bank Company Act, 1991, that stipulates as follows:

"৪৫। ৩১) বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক যদি এই মর্মে সন্তুষ্ট হয় যে,
(ক) জনস্বার্থে, বা
(খ)
(গ)
(ঘ) কোন ব্যাংক-কোম্পানীর যথাযথ ব্যবস্থাপনার নিশ্চিত করার জন্য সাধারণভাবে সকল ব্যাংক-কোম্পানীকে, অথবা বিশেষ কোন ব্যাংক-কোম্পানীকে নির্দেশ প্রদান করার প্রয়োজন, তাহা হইলে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক যথাযথ নির্দেশ জারি করিতে পারিবে এবং সংশ্লিষ্ট- ব্যাংক-কোম্পানী উক্ত নির্দেশ পালান করিতে বাধ্য থাকিবে।"
15. Therefore, as per provisions of sub-section (1) of section 45 of the Bank Companies Act, 1991, the BRPD Circular No. 7 dated 28-5-2015 has the force of law and the directions given in it are mandatory and shall prevail over the Service Rules of all Banks. The Banks are legally bound to comply with all the directions given in this circular as well as to amend their Services, if so required, to bring them in conformity to these directions given by the Bangladesh Bank.

16. I have also taken into consideration that, the termination letter was issued before issuance of the circular. But, it does not permit an arbitrary action, nor would protect any colorable action of any kind. Here, the bank is the employer, while the plaintiff as well as all other employees and officials (executives and non-executives) all are employees of the bank. Hence, in all cases of termination, discharge, removal or dismissal it has to be proved that the action was taken bonafide and the interest of the Bank, which is substantially run by public money.

17. Every authority, whosoever, must exercise the powers vested in it to secure the end for which such power has been vested. No colorable exercise of power is sustainable in law. No power can be exercised without a guideline or on a pick and choose basis or in violation of legitimate expectation of a person aggrieved by exercise of such powers. The master and servant Rule, that served the interest of the capricious masters of the colonial era and had governed the private sector employment for decades, should now yield to the principles of fair play legitimate expectation and access to justice.

18. Inspite of all these facts, the paramount and consistently adopted principle is that, whoever is vested with any power is duty bound to exercise such power bonafide, fairly, and to further the causes for which such power has been vested. Each and every power is an entrustment. It cannot be exercised by anyone merely for the reason that such power is available in his or her hands. One, who exercises any power, must also prove that the exercise of such powers was not intended to settle any personal issue, nor tainted by any personal or other bias, not abrupt, not peculiar, nor based on pick and choose, not arbitrary. Onus to prove that such power has been exercised bonafide is on him who exercised the power. Any exercise of such power, in a public company, to victimize any person shall not be indulged by any court of law as in the case of the services under any public or statutory body.

19. The learned Advocate for the bank submits that, the plaintiff is a worker and he ought to have follow the procedure laid down in the Labour Act, 2006, before filing this suit, while he should have filed the case before the labour court. The learned Advocate for the plaintiff submits that, he is not a worker, rather he is an officer of the bank, since subsequently he has been promoted to the post of an officer. However, these are matter to be raised before and decided by the trial court.

20. Be that as it may, in view of the discussion made above, I am of the opinion that, the petition for rejection of plaint was not competent in this case and was rightly rejected by the trial court. Because, the petition for rejection of the plaint was based on the defence case and defence material, not on the averments made in the plaint. A petition for rejection of the plaint should be considered only with reference to averments made in the plaint. However, the trial court may frame, in an appropriate case, issue of law and decide the maintainability point as per provisions of Rule (2) of Order 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 1908.

21. The bank should issue release order in favour of the plaintiff in as much as it has asserted that this was a case of termination simpliciter.

22. In view of the discussion recorded above, this appeal and civil Rule should be disposed of.

Order
Accordingly, the FMA No. 33 of 2021 and the Civil Rule No. 104(FM) of 2020 are disposed of. The trial court is directed to decide the maintainability point, as per Rule (2) of Order 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, immediately, if such an issue of law is pressed before it. Otherwise, it should dispose of this case within 60 (sixty) working days from the date of receipt of this judgment and order. The Bank is further directed to issue release order to the plaintiff within 30 (thirty) working days from the date of receipt of this judgment and order and to submit an affidavit of compliance. The order of stay granted earlier by this court is hereby vacated. In exercise of the power vested in this Court under Article 112 of the Constitution of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, the General-Manager, BRPD, Bangladesh Bank, is directed to examine or cause to examine the Service Rules of all Banks to ensure that the Banks have complied with the directions given in BRPD Circular No. 07 dated 28-5-2015, since it has the force of law as per clause (Ka) and (Gha) of sub-section (1) of section 45 of the Bank Company Act, 1991. They should submit a compliance report within next 90 (ninety) working days to this Court, through the Registrar of this Court. However, if so prayed for, this time limit may be extended by the court for just reason. This judgment shall not have any bearing on the merit of the case. The trial court shall decide the issues on merit and independently. Let copies of this judgment be sent to the Governor, Bangladesh Bank, to the Registrar of the High Court Division, Supreme Court of Bangladesh and to the General-Manager, BRPD, Bangladesh Bank, information and doing the needful. No order as to cost. Copies of this judgment also be sent to the courts below at once.
