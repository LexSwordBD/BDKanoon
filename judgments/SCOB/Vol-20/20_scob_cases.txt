Date of hearing: 07-01-2025, 08-01-2025, 09-01-2025 & 14-01-2025

Date of judgment: 15-01-2025


JUDGMENT
Syed Refaat Ahmed, CJ:

1. The facts and issues in these cases are so inextricably entwined that these are necessarily, therefore, taken up for analogous consideration and disposal.

2. Criminal Appeal No. 64 of 2024 along with Criminal Appeal No. 63 of 2024, both preferred by Begum Khaleda Zia, alongside Criminal Appeal No. 42 of 2024, preferred by the Appellant Sharfuddin Ahmed, and Criminal Appeal No. 39 of 2024, preferred by the Appellant Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal, stem from Criminal Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos. 400 of 2019, 399 of 2019, 1371 of 2024, and 643 of 2019, respectively. These appeals challenge the judgment and order dated October 30, 2018, rendered by the High Court Division in Criminal Revision No. 741 of 2018, in conjunction with Criminal Appeal Nos. 1676 of 2018, 2292 of 2018, and 2215 of 2018, wherein the Rule was made absolute and the appeals were dismissed.

3. The prosecution case as discerned from the records is that one Harunur Rashid, the then Sub-Assistant Director (later on promoted to Deputy Director) of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), (Inquiry and Investigation-1), Head Office, Dhaka, acting as the informant, lodged a First Information Report (FIR) registered as Ramna Police Station Case No. 8 dated 3.7.2008 under sections 409 and 109 of the Penal Code, 1860 read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (PCA, 1947) and Rule 5 of the Emergency Power Rules, 2007 against seven individuals, including the Appellants. The FIR implicated the Appellants alleging, inter alia, that Begum Khaleda Zia, in her capacity as Prime Minister from 1991 to 1996, had Current Account No. 5416 dated 2.6.1991 opened in the name of the 'Prime Minister's Orphanage Fund' at Sonali Bank, Ramna Branch, Dhaka. It was further alleged that an amount of USD 1,255,000 (equivalent to BDT 4,44,81,216/-) was deposited into the said Current Account through Pay Order No. 153367970 from the United Saudi Commercial Bank on 9.6.1991.

4. The gravamen of the charges and accusations brought forth was, therefore, of a criminal breach of trust or a fiduciary responsibility evident in alleged wrongful dealings in entrusted funds.

5. The case strung together against Begum Khaleda Zia is that she in her capacity as Prime Minister was entrusted with certain property, in the present case being a specific quantum of trust fund, and contended to have dominion over fund property long after she left public office and dealt with such entrusted property in a manner as is liable to bring such action under the mischief of the Penal Code's provisions criminalizing the act of "Criminal Breach of Trust" (section 409). Begum Zia is additionally alleged by the prosecution to have abetted irregular dealings in such entrusted property at all material times of her alleged sustained dominion over such property.

6. The offence of criminal breach of trust, it must be noted at the outset, has essential constituent elements prescribed by the law (i.e., section 405 of the Penal Code) as identifies illegal use of entrusted property for personal gain as the core element of the prosecution's case to satisfy the test of law. Central, therefore, to the establishment of such breach of trust is the violation of a fiduciary duty evident, for example, in a dishonest misappropriation or conversion for personal use or gain (as punished under section 403 of the Penal Code) or any other dishonest use or disposal of that property in violation of either the law or any contract.

7. The prosecution case further asserts that the Appellant, Begum Khaleda Zia, did not utilize the aforementioned funds for the benefit of any orphanage within the country between 9.6.1991 and 5.9.1993. Moreover, she neither formulated any rules for the administration of the said Orphanage nor adhered to the existing regulations concerning the operation and management of any orphanages or trusts as such. Instead, on 5.9.1993, she established the 'Zia Orphanage Trust' ('Trust') with the intent to dishonestly misappropriate the said amount through her family members. She registered the Trust at the Gulshan Sub-Registry Office under Registration No. IV-30, listing the address as 6, Shaheed Mainul Road, Dhaka. Subsequently, she nominated her elder son, Mr. Tarique Rahman, her younger son, late Arafat Rahman, and her sister-in-law's son, Mr. Mominur Rahman as members of the Board of Trustees. Furthermore, Mr. Tarique Rahman was designated as the author of the Trust (settlor). Thereafter, she opened STD Bank Account No. 7 on 9.10.1993 through Mr. Tarique Rahman in the name of the Trust at Sonali Bank, New North Circle Branch, Gulshan, Dhaka, and transferred BDT 2,33,33,500/- from Current Account No. 5416 of the 'Prime Minister's Orphanage Fund' to STD Account No. 7 of the Trust through cheque number 8431103 dated 13.11.1993 for the establishment of an orphanage in Bogura. Subsequently, on 4.2.1993 BDT 4,00,000/- was withdrawn from the said account, however, only BDT 2,77,000/- was spent to purchase 2.79 acres of land in the name of the Trust in Bogura. The remainder of the amount remained unspent for a considerable period, eventually accruing interest to reach BDT 3,37,09,757.32/- as of 12.4.2006.

8. The prosecution argued that the Appellant, Begum Khaleda Zia, at that juncture and with the fraudulent intent of misappropriating the sum of BDT 3,37,09,757.32 standing in STD Account No. 7, in collusion with other Appellants, issued five cheques totaling BDT 3,30,00,000/-. The contention is that these transactions were predominantly executed through Mr. Tarique Rahman and Mr. Mominur Rahman. They in turn instructed the Appellant, Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal to open Fixed Deposit Receipts (FDRs) at Prime Bank Limited, Gulshan Branch. Consequently, Appellant Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal received all the aforementioned cheques and subsequently deposited them at Prime Bank Limited, Gulshan Branch. Thereafter, he directed the then Manager of the Branch, Mahmood Hossain to open FDR accounts upon the encashment and collection of the said cheques.

9. Out of the aforementioned cheques, Cheque No. 4882407 for an amount of BDT 50,00,000/- dated 12.4.2006 was encashed on 13.4.2006, and FDR No. 41029462 was opened on the same day in the name of the Appellant, Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal. Subsequently, the said FDR was encashed and a new FDR being No. 41033338 for BDT 50,68,450/- inclusive of interest, was opened on 16.7.2006 in the name of the Trust.

10. Further, Cheque No. 4882406 for BDT One crore dated 15.6.2006 was encashed on the same date and FDR No. 41032276 was opened in the name of Appellant Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal. Another cheque being No. 4882403 for BDT One crore dated 15.6.2006 was received by way of account payee transfer to the Trust and FDR No. 41032669 dated 27.6.2006 was opened in the name of the Trust.

11. The remaining two cheques dated 4.7.2006 and 5.7.2006 for amounts of BDT 50,00,000/- and BDT 30,00,000/- respectively were also credited via account payee transfer to the Trust and a consolidated FDR being No. 4103317 for BDT 80,00,000/- was opened on 9.7.2006 in the name of the Trust.

12. Subsequently, pursuant to an oral instruction from the Appellant, Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal and an alleged purported resolution passed by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, Prime Bank Limited, Gulshan Branch, transferred two FDRs- one for BDT One Crore in the name of the Trust and another for the same amount in the name of the Appellant, Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal- to Prime Bank Limited, Eskaton Branch, through inter-bank credit advice. At the Eskaton Branch, an FDR bearing No. 41022619/73193, amounting to BDT 1,03,19,365/- inclusive of interest, was opened on 16.11.2006 in the joint names of the Appellant, Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal, and Syed Ahmed alias Sayeed Ahmed.

13. Another FDR bearing No. 41024435/73491 for BDT 1,06,38,686/- was opened on 7.2.2007 in the name of Gias Uddin Ahmed. Subsequently, the FDR held jointly in the names of Appellant Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal and Syed Ahmed was encashed and a fresh FDR being No. 41025511 for BDT 1,04,32,957.80/- inclusive of interest was opened on 7.2.2007 in the name of Gias Uddin Ahmed. Thereafter, Gias Uddin Ahmed encashed the aforementioned two FDRs on 15.2.2007 and caused the total amount of BDT 2,10,71,643.80/- to be issued in his name through six pay orders. The entirety of the proceeds was subsequently deposited into Current Account No. 11013134 of Prime Bank Limited, Eskaton Branch, belonging to his brother, Sharfuddin Ahmed. Subsequently, the total amount of BDT 2,10,71,643.80/- was withdrawn from the account of Sharfuddin Ahmed and allegedly misappropriated. Appellant Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal, in his capacity as the Chairman of Prime Bank Limited and wielding significant influence over the Branch Managers, is said to have, therefore, facilitated the opening of all the FDRs, their subsequent encashment and the eventual deposit of the proceeds into the account of Sharfuddin Ahmed. Thus comes to rest the story of the Appellants and the alleged misappropriation of the entire aforementioned sum of money.

14. Upon completion of the investigation, the Investigating Officer submitted a charge sheet, being Charge Sheet No. 372 dated 5.8.2009 against six accused persons, including the Appellants, under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the PCA, 1947. The case record was subsequently forwarded to the learned Metropolitan Senior Special Judge, Dhaka, who, by an order dated 7.9.2009, took cognizance of the offences against the Appellants and the other accused persons. Thereafter, the case was transferred to the Special Judge Court No. 3, Dhaka, for trial, where it was registered as Special Case No. 3 of 2010. On 19.3.2014, the learned Special Judge, Court No. 3, Dhaka, framed charges against the Appellants and the other accused persons under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the PCA, 1947. The charges were duly read over and explained to the accused persons, to which they all pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried in accordance with law. Thereafter, the case was eventually transferred from the Special Judge Court No.3, Dhaka to the Special Judge Court No. 5, Dhaka for holding trial and the same was renumbered as Special Case No. 17 of 2017.

15. During the course of the trial, the prosecution examined thirty-two witnesses out of the thirty-six listed. The Appellants cross-examined certain witnesses, while declined to cross-examine others. Appellant Begum Khaleda Zia cross-examined twenty-three witnesses yet opted not to examine any defence witnesses. In contrast, Appellant Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal examined one defence witness, while Appellant Sharfuddin Ahmed examined three defence witnesses in support of their respective cases. Upon the conclusion of the examination of witnesses, the Appellants were examined under section 342 of the CrPC, during which they categorically asserted their innocence of the charges brought against them.

16. The defence case, as articulated by the Appellant Begum Khaleda Zia in her statement read out in Court and as reflected in the tenor of the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses conducted by the Counsel for the Appellants, may be summarized as follows: No fund exists under the name of the 'Prime Minister's Orphanage Fund', and Begum Khaleda Zia neither had any involvement in the opening of Bank Account No. 5416 in the name of the purported fund, nor in the transfer of any money from the said account. It is further contended that the fund in question was brought by late Mr. Mustafizur Rahman, the then Foreign Minister, from the Emir of Kuwait as a donation intended for the welfare of orphans in Bangladesh, established in the name of late President Ziaur Rahman. The Appellant maintains her innocence, claiming that the case was instituted against her with mala fide intent, motivated by political considerations aimed at harassing her, and tarnishing her public image. She has unequivocally stated that she was neither the settlor, nor a trustee, nor a beneficiary of the Trust in question. The defence stance of the other Appellants aligns with that of Begum Khaleda Zia. They contend that no misappropriation of funds occurred, and no offence was committed as alleged in the FIR.

17. Upon the conclusion of the trial, the learned Special Judge of Special Judge Court No. 5, Dhaka, by judgment and order dated 8.2.2018 convicted the Appellant Begum Khaleda Zia under sections 409 and 109 of the Penal Code. She was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a term of five years and directed to pay a fine of BDT 2,10,71,643.80/- to be borne equally by all the convicted persons. The remaining Appellants were convicted under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code and each was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a term of ten years. Additionally, they were ordered to jointly pay the fine of BDT 2,10,71,643.80/- to be equally shared by all the convicted individuals.

18. Being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed upon Appellant Begum Khaleda Zia, which the Respondent 'Durnity Daman Commission' or the ACC deemed inadequate, the Commission filed Criminal Revision No. 741 of 2018 before the High Court Division seeking an enhancement of the sentence and, accordingly, obtained a Rule. Concurrently, being discontented with the judgment and order dated 8.2.2018 Appellant Begum Khaleda Zia preferred Criminal Appeal No. 1676 of 2018 before the High Court Division challenging her conviction and sentence. Additionally, Appellant Sharfuddin Ahmed, aggrieved by the same judgment and order filed Criminal Appeal No. 2292 of 2018, while Appellant Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal preferred Criminal Appeal No. 2215 of 2018, both before the High Court Division, contesting their respective convictions and sentences.

19. The High Court Division, after hearing Criminal Appeal No. 1676 of 2018 together with Criminal Appeals No. 2215 of 2018 and No. 2292 of 2018 and Criminal Revision No. 741 of 2018, analogously dismissed the appeals and made the Rule absolute in Criminal Revision on 30.10.2018. The High Court Division convicted Appellant Begum Khaleda Zia under section 409 of the Penal Code as well as section 5(2) of the PCA, 1947. Consequently, her sentence was enhanced to rigorous imprisonment for a period of ten years, and the fine imposed by the learned Special Judge was upheld.

20. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of the High Court Division, the Appellants preferred Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos. 400 of 2019, 399 of 2019, 1371 of 2024, and 643 of 2019 before this Division. Upon due consideration, leave was granted in all the petitions primarily on the grounds that the petitions had merit for consideration.

21. The facts-in-common providing the essential premise for CPLA Nos. 399 and 400 of 2019 filed on behalf of the Petitioner-Appellant Begum Khaleda Zia, the leave granting orders dated 11.11.2024 in both petitions record identical statements as to the case argued in defence before the High Court Division disposing of Criminal Revision No. 741 of 2018 with Criminal Appeal Nos. 1676 of 2018, 2215 of 2018 and 2292 of 2018. That statement-in-common featuring in both leave granting orders is reproduced hereinbelow:

"The defence case, as it transpires from the statement of the petitioner which was read out by her in Court and the trend of cross-examination of the witnesses, in brief, is that there is no such fund as PM's Orphanage Fund and she was never involved with the opening of the Bank Account being No. 5416 in the name of Prime Minister's Orphanage Fund or the transfer of money from the said account. Late Mustafizur Rahman, the then Foreign Minister, brought the said fund from the Amir of Kuwait who donated the same for the well-being of the orphans in Bangladesh in the name of the President Ziaur Rahman. She is innocent and this case has been initiated against her for political harassment and to tarnish her image before the countrymen. She was neither the settlor, nor a trustee, nor a beneficiary of the said Trust."

22. In CPLA No. 400 of 2019 arising out of Criminal Revision No. 741 of 2018 dealing with the issue of enhancement of the sentence of the Petitioner-Appellant Begum Khaleda Zia. The grounds taken were-

I. For that the High Court Division committed error of law in enhancing the sentence of the petitioner without any reasons or observation as to why the sentence of the learned Special Judge, Special Judge Court No.5, Dhaka in Special Case No. 17 of 2017 was considered as inadequate;

II. For that the High Court Division committed error of law in enhancing the sentence of the petitioner to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment merely on the ground that since other convicts were awarded 10 years of rigorous imprisonment, the petitioner was also required to be awarded the same sentence, without considering the lack of the evidence of involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence;

III. For that the High Court Division committed an error of law in convicting the petitioner by holding that it was her obligation "to secure due welfare and proper use of fund obtained as no such requirement exists either under section 5(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 or section 409 of the Penal Code;

IV. For that no documentary evidence having been adduced to indicate the aims and objects of the entrustment, the High Court Division committed error of law in holding that the fund was dealt with contrary to the aims and objects of the entrustment;

V. For that enhancement of sentence can be made only in appeal against the original Judgment passed in general law in view of Section 423(bb) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but the petitioner has been convicted under Section 409 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 against which appeal lies under Section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. However, Section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 provides no provision for enhancement of sentence under that Act and as such, the Criminal Revision No. 741 of 2018 filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission is void ab initio. Consequently, the Judgment and order passed by the High Court Division convicting the petitioner and others under Section 409 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 is liable to be vitiated as a whole;

VI. For that section 439(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly bars revision where appeal lies but the respondent being misconceived of law filed revision for enhancement of sentence which is not sustainable in law and as such, the Judgment and order of conviction and sentence of the petitioner is liable to be set aside as a whole.

23. On the other hand, the grounds taken in CPLA No. 399 of 2019 filed against the High Court Division's judgment and order dated 30.10.2018 affirming the conviction and enhancing the sentence of the Petitioner were-

I. Because the judgment and order of the High Court Division affirming the conviction of the petitioner and enhancing her sentence is based on (a) errors of law; and (b) misconceived views of law; and (c) gross non-reading and misreading of evidence on record; and (d) insufficient and/or no evidence on record and (e) bias and (f) the same is predicated upon fallacious presumptions and perverse reasoning, and as such, the judgment and order of the High Court Division is bad and unsustainable in law.

II. Because the judgment of the High Court Division is engulfed in errors of law in that:

a. For 'criminal breach of trust' to be proved there has to be proof of entrustment, misappropriation, conversion to one's dishonest own use, dishonest use or disposal of the property or willfully causing any other person to do any such act. In the process, one must gain unlawfully. In the instant case there is clear evidence on record that the fund in question is still intact and there has been no misappropriation or conversion or use or disposal of the fund for anyone's gain. The High Court Division, in the absence of any evidence of any such 'gain' of the petitioner or any one, has erroneously made up a case that the fund had not been used for 13 years and therefore, the offence of criminal breach of trust has been committed.

b. the High Court Division made an error in analyzing section 5(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 holding that the petitioner 'allowed' others to dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriate the fund while there is convincing evidence on record that the fund in question remains intact in the account of the Zia Orphanage Trust and there is no evidence on record that any person was ever benefited or gained from any transaction of the funds of the said trust or any person enjoyed the fund of the said trust in any manner.

c. the High Court Division has referred the notions of belief or observation of 'prudent' and 'reasonable' man in the judgment disregarding and ignoring that the standard of proof demanded in any criminal trial is that of proving facts 'beyond reasonable doubt'.

d. The High Court division wrongly shifted the burden of proof to the defense erroneously holding that the Appellant-Petitioner had 'entrustment' and control and domain over the fund without first establishing the same by clear and cogent evidence. Moreover, the defense was also denied of the opportunity to adduce additional evidence to prove its version of the facts.

e. The High Court Division has assailed Appellant-Petitioner for 'deliberate inaction' regarding the non- use of the trust fund. The High Court Division is palpably wrong in coming to such conclusion since (i) the petitioner had no connection with the Sonali Bank Account and (ii) even if it is accepted arguendo that the petitioner had knowledge of transfer of funds to Zia Orphanage trust, she had no reason and legal obligation to supervise the conduct of a private trust fund as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

f. The High Court Division's finding that the Zia Orphanage Trust is a "paper trust" is a wrong finding under the Trust Act and as per the evidence on record. Merely because a 'trust' or any legal entity remains dormant for some time, does not render a trust 'paper trust' or non-entity in law. The Zia orphanage Trust in its attempt to commence activity purchased a piece of land in Bogura measuring 2.79 acres.

g. the High Court Division committed error of law in convicting the Appellant-petitioner by holding that it was her obligation "to secure due welfare and proper use of fund obtained as no such requirement exists either under section 5(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 or section 409 of the Penal Code.

h. the High Court Division committed error of law in holding that the "non-functioning of the Trust and keeping the fund in the account of the said Trust for long 13 years" amounted to act and omission of inaction on the part of the petitioner allowing to cause wrongful gain of others which constituted act of misappropriation, whereas an omission/inaction in respect of any fund by way of entrustment cannot be regarded as misappropriation or breach of trust in law; rather requires some positive act on the part of a person entrusted with the fund.

24. It is to be noted that earlier on 19.8.2024 this Division was in seisin of two Criminal Petitions for Leave to Appeal being Nos. 643 of 2019 and 1371 of 2024 filed by Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal and Sharfuddin Ahmed respectively. Both Petitioners being aggrieved by the High Court Division's judgment and order dated 30.10.2018 analogously disposing of Criminal Appeal Nos. 2215 and 2292 of 2018 respectively cited grounds on the basis of which leave was granted in each case to prefer appeals being Criminal Appeals Nos. 39 and 42 of 2024 respectively. The grounds taken in CPLA No. 643 of 2019 are:

I. For that upon finding on an offence of abetment of criminal breach of trust, the High Court Division should have been satisfied that the convict-petitioner either instigated the principal offender, Begum Khaleda Zia to commit criminal breach of trust or engaged with her in any conspiracy and as result of which criminal breach of trust. The High Court Division, without being satisfied as to the basic principles of actus reus (external element) and mens rea (mental element) elements of the offence of abetment under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code, came to an erroneous conclusion that the convict-petitioner abetted criminal breach of trust. Hence, the judgment and order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside.

II. For that section 109 of the Penal Code, 1860 stipulates that intentional aiding, conspiracy or instigation is not enough to constitute the offence of abetment of criminal breach of trust and the prosecution has to prove that criminal breach of trust took place as a consequence of such conspiracy, intentional aiding or instigation.

III. For that when the amount of Tk. 2,33,33,500/- was transferred in 1993 from Prime Minister's Orphanage Fund to Zia Orphanage Trust through criminal breach of trust or misappropriation, it became stolen property as per section 410 of the Penal Code.

IV. For that the High Court Division found that the transactions that took place between 1993 and 2007 was a single transaction. That being so, the nature of the offence committed by each of the participants may be different depending on the facts of the case. Since the convict-petitioner received stolen property, he should have been charged and tried only under section 411 of the Penal Code 1860 for handling stolen property. Hence, the judgment and order of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.

25. The grounds taken in CPLA No. 1371 of 2024 are:

I. For that the convict-petitioner had nothing to do with the fund as he is admittedly not a trustee of the Zia Orphanage Trust. Ingredients or elements of offence under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code or element of any offence under any law has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt against the convict-petitioner.

II. For that the prosecution case is unspecific, vague and ambiguous. The prosecution failed to prove the ingredients of section 409 or section 109 of the Penal Code against the convict-petitioner beyond reasonable doubt.

III. For that the convict-petitioner is not a merchant or agent and he not being a merchant or agent, he cannot be tried for commission of offence under section 409 of the Penal Code and as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence against the petitioner is liable to be set aside.

IV. For that the prosecution has failed to prove any entrustment of property upon the convict-petitioner or entrustment of any dominion over property in any manner defined under section 405 of the Penal Code or dishonest misappropriation of property as defined under section 403 of the Penal Code.

26. Consequently, Criminal Appeal Nos. 63, 64, 42, and 39 of 2024 were instituted before this Division. These appeals, having arisen from the same judgment, were heard analogously by this Division.

27. This Division being asked to take up first Criminal Appeal No. 64 of 2024 stemming from CPLA No. 400 of 2019, Mr. Zainul Abedin, the learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the Appellant Begum Khaleda Zia, along with other learned Senior Advocates Mr. A. M. Mahbub Uddin, Mr. Bodruddozza, Mr. Md. Ruhul Quddus, Mr. Kayser Kamal, and Mr. Kazi Akhtar Hosain, the learned Advocate made submissions asserting that the High Court Division erred in law by enhancing the Appellant's sentence without providing reasons or observations as to why the sentence imposed by the learned Special Judge, Special Judge Court No. 5, Dhaka, in Special Case No. 17 of 2017 was deemed inadequate. They contended that the High Court Division further erred in law by enhancing the Appellant's sentence to ten years of rigorous imprisonment solely on the basis that other convicts were awarded the same sentence. Additionally, they argued that the High Court Division erred in law by convicting the Appellant on the grounds that she was obligated to ensure the proper use and welfare of the obtained funds even given that no such requirement exists either under section 5(1) of PCA, 1947 or section 409 of the Penal Code. Moreover, they highlighted that no documentary evidence was presented to indicate any declared aims and objectives of the entrustment, and thus, the High Court Division erred in law by holding that the funds were dealt with contrary to the aims and objectives of the entrustment. They further skillfully argued that the enhancement of the sentence can only be made in an appeal against the original judgment under general law in view of section 423(bb) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (CrPC). However, the Appellant was convicted under section 409 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the PCA, 1947, against which an appeal otherwise lies under section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. Since section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 provides no provision for the enhancement of the sentence under that Act, the Criminal Revision No. 741 of 2018 filed by the ACC is void ab initio. Consequently, the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division convicting the Petitioner-Appellant and others is liable to be vitiated as a whole. They also contended that section 439(5) of the CrPC clearly bars revision where an appeal lies, but the ACC, being misconceived of the law, filed a revision for the enhancement of the sentence, which is not sustainable in law. Thus, they have vigorously argued for the judgment and order of conviction and the sentence to be set aside in their entirety.

28. The same set of lawyers appearing for the Appellant, Begum Khaleda Zia in Criminal Appeal No. 63 of 2024 stemming from CPLA No. 399 of 2019 made submissions stating, inter alia, that the judgment of the High Court Division affirming her conviction on the charge of criminal breach of trust and enhancing her sentence is based on (a) errors of law, (b) misconceived views of law, (c) gross non-reading and misreading of evidence on record, (d) insufficient and/or no evidence on record, (e) bias, and (f) predicated upon fallacious presumptions and perverse reasoning, and as such, the judgment and order of the High Court Division are bad and unsustainable in law. In substantiation, the learned lawyers have strenuously argued that the judgment of the High Court Division is engulfed in errors of law for the reasons below:

a. As 'criminal breach of trust to be proved there has to be proof of entrustment, misappropriation, conversion to one's dishonest own use, dishonest use or disposal of the property or willfully causing any other person to do any such act. In the process, one must gain unlawfully. In the instant case there is clear evidence on record that the fund in question is still intact and there has been no misappropriation or conversion or use or disposal of the fund for anyone's gain. The High Court Division, in the absence of any evidence of any such 'gain' of the Appellant or any one, has erroneously made up a case that the fund had not been used for thirteen years and, therefore, the offence of criminal breach of trust has been committed.

b. The High Court Division made an error in analyzing section  of the PCA, 1947 holding that the Petitioner-Appellant 'allowed' others to dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriate the fund while there is convincing evidence on record that the fund in question remains intact in the account of the Trust and there is no evidence on record that any person was ever benefited or gained from any transaction of the funds of the said trust or any person enjoyed the fund of the said trust in any manner.

c. The High Court Division has employed the tests of the belief or observation of the 'prudent' and 'reasonable' man in the judgment disregarding and ignoring that the standard of proof demanded in any criminal trial is that of proving facts 'beyond reasonable doubt'.

d. The High Court Division wrongly shifted the burden of proof to the defence erroneously holding that the Appellant had 'entrustment' and control and domain over the fund without first establishing the same by clear and cogent evidence. Moreover, the defence was also denied of the opportunity to adduce additional evidence to prove its version of the facts.

e. The High Court Division has assailed the Appellant for 'deliberate inaction' regarding the non-use of the trust fund. The High Court Division is palpably wrong in coming to such conclusion since (i) the Appellant had no connection with the Sonali Bank Account and (ii) even if it is accepted arguendo that she had knowledge of the transfer of funds to Trust, she had no reason and legal obligation to supervise the conduct of a private trust fund as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

f. The High Court Division's finding that the Trust is a "paper trust" is a wrong finding under the Trusts Act, 1882 and as per the evidence on record. Merely because a 'trust' or any legal entity remains dormant for some time, does not render a trust 'paper trust' or a non-entity in law. This Court is reminded in this regard that the Trust in its attempt to commence activity purchased a piece of land in Bogura measuring 2.79 acres.

g. The High Court Division committed error of law in convicting the Appellant by holding that it was her obligation to secure due welfare and proper use of the fund obtained given that no such requirement exists either under section  of either the PCA, 1947 or section 409 of the Penal Code.

h. The High Court Division committed error of law in holding that the "non-functioning of the Trust and keeping the fund in the account of the said Trust for long 13 years" amounted to act and omission/inaction on the part of the Appellant allowing to cause wrongful gain of others which constituted act of misappropriation, whereas an omission/inaction in respect of any fund by way of entrustment cannot be regarded as misappropriation or breach of trust in law, rather the act of misappropriation necessarily incorporates an element of a positive act on the part of a person entrusted with the fund.

29. Mr. Ruhul Quddus, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the convict-Appellant Sharfuddin Ahmed in Criminal Appeal No. 42 of 2024 has made submissions on the grounds that the said Appellant had nothing to do with the fund as he is admittedly not a trustee of the Trust and that the ingredients or elements of the offence under sections 409 read with 109 of the Penal Code or element of any offence under any law have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt against him. Mr. Quddus further submits that the prosecution case is unspecific, vague and ambiguous and that the prosecution failed to prove the ingredients of either section 409 or section 109 of the Penal Code against the said Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. In this regard it is emphasized that the Appellant is not a merchant or agent and, therefore, cannot be tried for commission of offence under section 409 of the Penal Code and as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence against him are liable to be set aside. Highlighted also is the fact that the prosecution has failed to prove any entrustment of property upon this Appellant or any control or any dominion over such property in any manner defined under section 405 of the Penal Code or dishonest misappropriation of property as defined under section 403 of the Penal Code.

30. Mr. S.M. Shajahan, learned Senior Advocate with Mr. Kayser Kamal, learned Advocate on behalf of the Appellant Qazi Saleemul Huq alias Qazi Kamal in Criminal Appeal No. 39 of 2024 has made submissions stating that in arriving at a finding of an offence of abetment of criminal breach of trust, the High Court Division lost sight of the essential fact that this particular Appellant neither instigated the alleged principal offender, Begum Khaleda Zia to commit criminal breach of trust nor engaged with her in any conspiracy resulting in any criminal breach of trust. Instead, the High Court Division, without being satisfied as to the basic principles of actus reus (external element) and mens rea (mental element) elements of the offence of abetment under sections 409 and 109 of the Penal Code read together, came to an erroneous conclusion that this Appellant abetted the offence of criminal breach of trust. Hence, Messrs. Shajahan and Kamal argue, the judgment and order of conviction and sentence in this instance as well are liable to be set aside given that section 109 of the Penal Code stipulates that intentional aiding, conspiracy or instigation is not enough to constitute the offence of abetment of criminal breach of trust and the prosecution has to go the extra length to prove that criminal breach of trust took place as a consequence of such conspiracy, intentional aiding or instigation.

31. The grounds posited on the other hand by the Respondents, including the ACC, in each instances merit recording here before a consideration of the positioning of all parties concerned is undertaken on matters of fact and law. A snapshot of such grounds are, accordingly, provided below:

Criminal Appeal No. 39 of 2024

Grounds taken by the Respondent No. 1, State

32. The judgment and order of trial court was based on documentary, oral and material evidences available on record which supported the prosecution case while the defence failed to prove his case. Therefore, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division deserves to be affirmed by this Court.

Grounds taken by the Respondent No. 2, ACC

33. In order to constitute an offence under section 409 of the Penal Code there must be the allegation of entrustment of property or dominion over in someone's capacity of being a public servant or banker and misappropriation thereof, however, in absence of either of the aforesaid two ingredients the offence is not complete. Therefore, the appeal may be disposed of on merit for the ends of justice.

34. In view of section 423 (bb) of CrPC the enhancement of sentence can be made only in appeal against the judgment and order of sentence passed by the trial court under general law. However, in the case in hand the Appellant was convicted under section 409 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the PCA, 1947 against which appeal lies under section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. Therefore, the appeal may be disposed of on merit for the ends of justice.

Criminal Appeal No. 63 of 2024

Grounds taken by the Respondent No. 1, State

Similar to Criminal Appeal No. 39 of 2024

35. In order to constitute an offence under section 409 of the Penal Codethere must be the allegation of entrustment of property or dominion over in someone's capacity of being a public servant or banker and misappropriation thereof, however, in absence of either of the aforesaid two ingredients the offence is not complete.

36. An essential ingredient of offence under section 5(2) of the PCA, 1947 is that there must be the allegation of accepting or obtaining any gratification other than legal remuneration or dishonest or fraudulent misappropriation or receipt of pecuniary advantage by the public servant. In order to prove the same the accused person or any other person on his behalf shall have in possession, for which the accused person cannot satisfactorily account of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known source of income. Therefore, the appeal may be disposed of on merit for the ends of justice.

Grounds taken by the Respondent No. 2, ACC

Similar to Criminal Appeal No. 39 of 2024

37. Possessed of such facts agitated and legal tenets enunciated, this Division is, however, constrained to preliminarily opine that the facta probabilia' of these appeals taken together cumulatively gravitate towards the attraction first and foremost of the Trusts Act, 1882 to these cases, an inevitability which inexplicably has eluded the courts below. It is to that lapse and the entire breadth of supporting jurisprudence consequentially left by the wayside to which me must now unavoidably turn in the disposal of these appeals.

38. Sections 23 and 94 of the Trusts Act accordingly merit a visitation at this juncture-

"23. Liability for breach of trust- Where the trustee commits a breach of trust, he is liable to make good the loss which the trust-property or the beneficiary has thereby sustained, unless the beneficiary has by fraud induced the trustee to commit the breach, or the beneficiary, being competent to contract, has himself, without coercion or undue influence having been brought to bear on him, concurred in the breach, or subsequently acquiesced therein, with full knowledge of the facts of the case and of his right as against the trustee.

A trustee committing a breach of trust is not liable to pay interest except in the following cases:-

(a) where he has actually received interest:

(b) where the breach consists in unreasonable delay in paying trust-money to the beneficiary:

(c) where the trustee ought to have received interest, but has not done so:

(d) where he may be fairly presumed to have received interest.

He is liable, in case (a), to account for the interest actually received, and, in cases (b), (c) and (d), to account for simple interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum, unless Court otherwise directs.

(e) where the breach consists in failure to invest trust-money and to accumulate the interest or dividends thereon, he is liable to account for compound interest (with half-yearly rests) at the same rate.

(f) where the breach consists in the employment of trust-property or the proceeds thereof in trade or business, he is liable to account, at the option of the beneficiary, either for compound interest (with half-yearly rests) at the same rate, or for the net profits made by such employment.

Illustrations

(a) A trustee improperly leaves trust-property outstanding, and it is consequently lost: he is liable to make good the property lost, but he is not liable to pay interest thereon.

(b) A bequeaths a house to B in trust to sell it and pay the proceeds to C. B neglects to sell the house for a great length of time, whereby the house is deteriorated and its market price falls. B is answerable to C for the loss.

(c) A trustee is guilty of unreasonable delay in investing trust-money in accordance with section 20, or in paying it to the beneficiary. The trustee is liable to pay interest thereon for the period of the delay.

(d) The duty of the trustee is to invest trust-money in any of the securities mentioned in section 20, clause (a), (b), (c) or (d). Instead of so doing he retains the money in his hands. He is liable, at the option of the beneficiary, to be charged either with the amount of the principal money and interest, or with the amount of such securities as he might have purchased with the trust-money when the investment should have been made, and the intermediate dividends and interest thereon.

(e) The instrument of trust directs the trustee to invest trust-money either in any such securities or on mortgage of immoveable property. The trustee does neither. He is liable for the principal money and interest.

(f) The instrument of trust directs the trustee to invest trust-money in any of such securities and to accumulate the dividends thereon. the trustee disregards the direction. He is liable, at the option of the beneficiary, to be charged either with the amount of the principal money and compound interest, or with the amount of such securities as he might have purchased with the trust-money when the investment should have been made, together with the amount of the accumulation which would have arisen from a proper investment of the intermediate dividends.

(g) Trust-property is invested in one of the securities mentioned in section 20, clause (a), (b), (c) or (d). The trustee sells such security for some purpose not authorised by the terms of the instrument of trust. He is liable, at the option of the beneficiary, either to replace the security with the intermediate dividends and interest thereon, or to account for the proceeds of the sale with interest thereon.

(h) The trust-property consists of land. The trustee sells the land to a purchaser for a consideration without notice of the trust. The trustee is liable, at the option of the beneficiary, to purchase other land of equal value to be settled upon the like trust, or to be charged with the proceeds of the sale with interest.";

"94. Constructive trusts in cases not expressly provided for- In any case not coming within the scope of any of the preceding sections, where there is no trust, but the person having possession of property has not the whole beneficial interest therein, he must hold the property for the benefit of the persons having such interest, or the residue thereof (as the case may be), to the extent necessary to satisfy their just demands.

Illustrations

(a) A, an executor, distributes the assets of his testator B to the legatees without having paid the whole of B's debts. The legatees hold for the benefit of B's creditors, to the extent necessary to satisfy their just demands, the assets so distributed.

(b) A by mistake assumes the character of a trustee for B, and under colour of the trust receives certain money. B may compel him to account for such moneys.

(c) A makes a gift of a lac of Taka to B, reserving to himself, with B's assent, power to revoke at pleasure the gift as to Tk. 10,000. The gift is void as to Tk. 10,000, and B holds that sum for the benefit of A."

39. It would be apt too to introduce at this juncture the essential components of the 1993 Trust Deed setting up the 'Zia Orphanage Trust'.

Summary of the relevant contents of the Trust Deed

40. Settlor and Trustees:

The settler of this trust is Tarique Rahman. The trustees appointed under the deed are Tarique Rahman, Mr. Arafat Rahman, and Mr. Mominur Rahman.

41. Beneficiaries:

The beneficiaries encompass two primary groups:

All direct descendants, both male and female, of the children of the settler and his brother.

All orphans residing in Bangladesh who have lost one or both parents or fulfills other prescribed criteria.

42. Trust Objectives:

The central objective of the trust is to provide aid and support to Muslim orphans throughout Bangladesh. Specifically, the trust aims to utilize all generated income towards the fulfillment of its objectives. The trustees are empowered to acquire, lease, construct, and manage both movable and immovable properties. This includes the authority to transfer, sell, lease, or rent any part of the trust's holdings as deemed appropriate by the Board of Trustees.

43. Financial Operations:

The trust is authorized to raise funds through diverse means, including accepting gifts, donations, grants, loans, and other forms of financial aid. This can be from governmental, private, or other sources, both within Bangladesh and internationally. The acceptance of foreign loans or donations is contingent upon approval from the relevant Bangladeshi government authorities. The Board of Trustees is responsible for investing the trust's assets to maximize profitability while adhering to the laws of Bangladesh. The deed specifically permits investment through various instruments, including Fixed Deposit Receipts (FDRs).

44. Initial Property:

The initial property allocated to the trust comprises a sum of 100,000 Taka (One lac).

45. Upon an examination of the relevant provisions of the Trusts Act, 1882, it is clear that the said Act provides a remedy for the act of criminal breach of trust. Section 23 stipulates that a trustee committing a criminal breach of trust is liable to make good the loss sustained by the trust property or the beneficiary as a result. A plain reading of this section indicates that the law regards criminal breach of trust primarily as a civil wrong capable of redress through an appropriate remedy awarded to the party who has suffered loss. The statutory framework under the Trusts Act does not encompass criminal sanctions for such breaches, instead it directs the court to determine the appropriate civil remedy based on the loss caused.

46. Predicated on the above, for conduct amounting to a criminal breach of trust, which is inherently a civil matter, to attract criminal liability, additional elements must be present. As the Supreme Court of India held in Delhi Race Club (1940) Ltd and Ors vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr, reported in 2024 INSC 626; AIR 2024 SC; 4531 that-

"Every act of criminal breach of trust may not result in a penal offence of criminal breach of trust unless there is evidence of manipulating act of fraudulent misappropriation. An act of criminal breach of trust involves a civil wrong in respect of which the person may seek his remedy for damages in civil courts but, any criminal breach of trust with a mens rea, gives rise to criminal prosecution as well."

47. This essential mental element, the mens rea, distinguishes a civil breach from the offence of criminal breach of trust under the Penal Code. Indeed, the relevant provision of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 also requires proof of such a culpable mental state.

48. Criminal breach of trust, as defined under section 405 of the Penal Code, involves the dishonest misappropriation or conversion of property entrusted to the accused for their own use. The provision explicitly requires 'dishonest intention' (mens rea) as a prerequisite for establishing the offence. Therefore, the prosecution must prove both the physical act of misappropriation or conversion (the actus reus) and the necessary dishonest state of mind (mens rea) accompanying that act. As held by the Supreme Court of India in Mitesh Kumar J. Sha vs. The State of Karnataka and others, reported in 2021 INSC 675; AIR 2021 SC 5298 that where the essential ingredients for the criminal offence are not made out, there can be no sustainable case of criminal breach of trust. Similarly, the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh ruled in Md. Ayubur Rahman vs. State reported in 56 DLR (2004) 281 that it constitutes an abuse of the court's process to continue criminal proceedings when the prima facie ingredients of the offences, including criminal breach of trust, cannot be established. In the present case, it is this Court's finding, accordingly, that the facts alleged do not demonstrate that the property in question was misappropriated. Consequently, as the act of misappropriation itself has not been established, the requisite dishonest intention cannot logically and readily be inferred. Significantly further, on reviewing the terms and conditions of the trust deed, the Court does not identify any clear breach of its provisions. Nevertheless, even assuming for the sake of argument that a criminal breach of trust did occur, the proper course of action would be to pursue a civil remedy. The essential element of mens rea required to found a criminal charge is wholly absent on the facts presented. Furthermore, the necessary concurrence of mens rea and actus reus cannot be established principally because the factual account fails to demonstrate that any act of misappropriation took place.

49. The spectre of malicious prosecution has loomed large in this case from its inception onwards and it is to that disquieting element of the manner of prosecution of this case to which this Court must unavoidably now turn. At the very inception of these cases, consecutively two Investigating Officers (I.O.s) named Mr. Nur Mohammad and Mr. Harunur Rashid investigated the case. The  I.O. Mr. Nur Mohammad filed charge sheet on 11.6.2008 chargesheeting five accused persons among whom Begum Khaleda Zia did not figure. The said I.O. particularly mentioned at the end of his Report that-

"অনুসন্ধানকালে নির্দিষ্ট সময়সীমার মধ্যে প্রাক্তন প্রধানমন্ত্রীর অফিস হতে প্রধানমন্ত্রীর এতিম তহবিলের সংশ্লিষ্ট নথি এবং সংশ্লিষ্ট তথ্য সম্বলিত কাগজপত্র সরবরাহ না করায় প্রাক্তন প্রধানমন্ত্রী বেগম খালেদা জিয়ার সম্পৃক্ততা সম্বন্ধে মতামত প্রদান করা সম্ভব হচ্ছে না।"

50. The  I.O. Mr. Harunur Rashid submitted charge sheet copying the Report of the  L.O. in toto only adding a paragraph at the end of the report where he implicated Begum Khaleda Zia. It is noted that Harunur Rashid was discharged from his job in 2005 during the BNP-regime due to his illegal appointment at the Bureau of Anti-Corruption. He resumed his position in 2008 at the ACC (the successor entity to the Bureau as established through the Anti-Corruption Commission Act of 2004) and took the charge of the investigation of the present case immediately at the heels of such joining. This provides the essential context of the investigation at this stage being tainted with malice reflected in the added paragraph implicating Begum Khaleda Zia.

51. Moreover, the  I.O. submitted charge sheet under sections 406/109 of the Penal Code on 11.6.2008. The  I.O. filed another charge sheet under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code on 25.6.2008. Section 406 as deals with the offence of criminal breach of trust simpliciter notably, however, is not included in the schedule to the Anti-Corruption Commission Act. To bring the case, therefore, under the purview of the said Act, the  I.O. inserted section 409 of the Code. This, it is argued on behalf of the Appellants was a deliberate and calculated act born out of malicious intention to bring the alleged acts of Begum Khaleda Zia and other Appellants under the scanner by way of an afterthought given section 409's operational ambit covering criminal breaches of trust by public servants, banks, merchants, or agents.

52. It has been contended by the prosecution that Begum Khaleda Zia was liable as she was the Prime Minister and her Principal Secretary, Dr. Kamal Uddin Siddiqui appended his signature in the bank account opening form as well as cheques with the direction of the Prime Minister. This issue, however, has not been proved in the case. It has not escaped this Court's attention that the present case was filed while Begum Khaleda Zia was not in power. That provided the prosecution ample opportunity of bringing out the concerned note sheet (if any) with regard to the authorization of opening of bank account. That opportunity has been squandered seemingly by the prosecution and, therefore, Begum Khaleda Zia has been implicated without placing a single signature over any piece of document.

53. The apprehension that has resultantly been generated in the mind of this Court is that the prosecution filed the case without any cogent ground but with a specific design conceived and executed in the manner and form of the second investigation just to implicate a former Prime Minister. This fact does, in this Court's view, inescapably introduce the element of malice and unsavoury intention into this case.

54. Having, therefore, to contend with the omnipresence of malicious prosecution in this present instance, this Court is constrained to visit the foundations of law and the core constitutional guarantees as militate against the spectre of such ill-schemed mode of prosecution from being initiated and continued to highly unsalutary consequences.

55. Every individual, as per the entrenched protective provision of Article 31 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the inalienable right not only to be protected by the law but also to be treated in accordance with the law. The ambit of the protection so guaranteed shields against and action that in any way could be detrimental to a person's life, liberty, body, reputation, or property except when done in accordance with law. In other words, any action that otherwise detrimentally impinges upon these fundamental aspects of human existence and civic life must comply strictly with the dictates and mandates of the law properly understood and applied. It follows, therefore, that the constitutional space within which one is permitted to proceed against anyone is severely limited or restricted under Article 31 of the Constitution. The constitutional message, accordingly, to anyone about to embark on initiating prosecutory action against anyone is "tread with utmost discretion and caution" lest such action risks being singed by the firewall protection accorded under the Constitution to a supposed accused. Concomitantly, therefore, the right to sue anyone is hedged with or qualified strictly by the condition not to abuse that right by proceeding maliciously or without reasonable and probable cause. It is imperative that one must act to so prosecute with an honest intention to protect one's own or the public interest, or if the circumstances are such as to render it prima facie probable that the law is on one's side, regardless of one's motives. The bare fundamentals of the act of prosecution as laid out in Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 22 (2nd Ed. by Hailsham) at page 3 expressly, and aptly, highlight the component of "good reason" as essential to trigger off feasibly any prosecution exercise thus:

"A prosecution exists where a criminal charge is made before a judicial officer or tribunal and any person who makes or is actively instrumental in the making or prosecuting of such a charge is deemed to prosecute it, and is called the prosecutor. Thus a person who lays before a Magistrate an information stating that he suspects and has good reasons to suspect another, or who prefers a bill of indictment, is engaged in a prosecution; and he may be responsible for the prosecution, even though the charge made before the Magistrate is an oral.'

56. Professor Winfield on Torts, Sixth Edition, in Chapter 24, page 47, has this to say about the law of malicious prosecution:

"It had to make its way between two competing principles, the freedom of action that every man should have in bringing criminals to justice and the necessity for checking lying accusations of innocent people. For some time the Judges oscillated between apprehension of scaring off a just accuser and fear of encouraging a false one."

57. This Court opines, accordingly, in full subscription of the view above that the profundity of the judicial responsibility of discharging the duty of judicial scrutiny as so clearly highlighted by Winfield above ought not to be lost on anyone least of all the courts.

58. In realm of malicious prosecution there are two essential elements, namely, that no probable cause existed for instituting the prosecution or suit complained of, and that such prosecution or suit terminated in some way favorably to the defendant therein. In Black's Law Dictionary, malicious prosecution is stated to be:

"A judicial proceeding instituted against a person out of the prosecutor's malice and ill-will, with the intention of injuring him, without probable cause to sustain it, the process and proceedings being regular and formal, but not justified by the facts. For this injury an action on the case lies, called action of malicious prosecution."

59. Again, the missive here is for the courts to be ever vigilant against ill-intended proceedings not supported by law by lifting the veil of ostensible yet highly deceptive trappings of regularity.

60. The Law of Torts by Salmond, 14th Ed., (1965) at page 588, it has been stated as follows:

"In order that an action shall lie for malicious prosecution or the other forms of abusive process which have been referred to, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

(1) The proceedings must have been instituted or continued by the defendant.

(2) He must have acted without reasonable and probable cause.

(3) He must have acted maliciously.

(4) In certain classes of cases the proceedings must have been unsuccessful that is to say, must have terminated in favour of the plaintiff now suing.

"

61. Martin L. Newell, A Treatise on the Law of Malicious Prosecution, False Imprisonment, and the Abuse of Legal Process, 1892, page 6 outlines thus the crucial elements of and redress against malicious prosecution:

"A judicial proceeding, instituted by one person against another from wrongful or improper motives, and without probable cause to sustain it. It is usually called a malicious prosecution; and an action for damages for being subjected to such a suit is called an action for malicious prosecution."

62. It must be borne in mind that malice in the broader legal context is not only restricted to anger, hatred and revenge, but extends to encompass any other unlawful and unjustifiable motive. It may, therefore, be said that any motive, other than that of instituting criminal proceedings supported by a legally and reasonably substantiated prosecution case, is a malicious motive on the part of a person who acts under the influence of it. In the case of Province of East Bengal and Others vs. S.M. Faruque and Others reported in PLD 1959 268; LEX/HEPK/0035/1958, it was held that "reasonable and probable cause" means a genuine belief based on reasonable grounds that the proceedings are justified. In the case of Herniman vs. Smith 1938 AC 305 (316), Lord Atkin said that no better statement of what is reasonable and probable cause is to be found than in the following observation of Hawkins, J., in Hicks vs. Faulkner (1878) 8 Q BD 167:

I should define reasonable and probable cause to be an honest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon reasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances, which, assuming them to be true, would reasonably lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man, placed in the position of the accused to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of the crime imputed.

63. Similarly, Salmond on the Law of Torts, 9th Edition, pages 658-659, elaborates on a plaintiff's duty to take care thus:

"Having regard, however, to the facts known to the defendant, he must show a reasonably sound judgment and use reasonable care in determining whether there are sufficient grounds for the proceedings instituted by him, and any failure to exhibit such judgment or care will be imputed to him as a want of reasonable and probable cause."

64. In Mitchell vs. Jenkins, 5 B. & Ad. 594, by Parke, J.:

"The term malice.... is not to be considered in the sense of spite or hatred against an individual, but of malus animus, and as denoting that the party is actuated by improper and indirect motives."

65. In the case of Naber Shaha vs. Hamsuddin and ors. reported in 15 DLR (1963) 217; LEX/HEPK/0141/1962, it was observed:

"In a suit for malicious prosecution, rather to sustain an action for malicious prosecution the following essentials must to co-exist:-

(1) A prosecution of the plaintiff by the defendant.

(2) There must be a want of reasonable and probable cause for that prosecution.

(3) The defendant must have acted maliciously (i.e, with an improper motive and not to further the ends of justice.)

(4) The prosecution must have ended in favour of the person proceeded against.

(5) It must have caused damage to the party proceeded against.

66. The High Court of West Pakistan in the case of Abdur Rashid vs. The State Bank of Pakistan and Another reported in PLD 1970 344; LEX/HWPK/0209/1969 aptly expounded, in detail, the constitutive elements of malicious prosecution upon considering the development in the legal system USA, UK, Australia, India and Pakistan and merits reproduction in extenso:

"The term 'malice', in a prosecution of the nature which is before me, has been held not to be spite or hatred against an individual but of 'malus animus' and as denoting the working of improper and indirect motives. The proper motive for a prosecution is the desire to secure the ends of justice. It should, therefore, be shown that the prosecutor was not actuated by this desire but by his personal feelings--See Mitchell v. Jenkins (1833) 5 B & Ad. 588; Pike v. Waldrum (1952) 1 Lloyd's Rep. 431 and Stevens v. Midland Counties Ry. (1854) 10 Ex. 352. Further, malice should be proved by the plaintiff affirmatively: --Abrath v. N.E. Ry. (1886) 11 A C 247. Malice may sometime be inferred from absence of reasonable and probable cause, but this rule has no general application and there may be cases where it would be appropriate not to infer malice from unreasonableness. Further, if reasonable and probable cause is proved, the question of malice becomes irrelevant, and also defect of want of reasonable and probable cause cannot be supplied by evidence of malice--See Turner v. Ambler (1847) 10  В 252; Mitchell v. Jenkins; Brown v. Hawkes (1891) 2  B 718 and Herniman v. Smith (1938) A C 305. It would be proper here to quote the following observation of Denning, L.J. (as he then was) in Tempest v. Snowden (1952) 1 KB 130:

Even though a prosecutor is actuated by the most express malice, nevertheless he is not liable so long as there was reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution. The same rule has been applied by the Courts in India and Pakistan. Several decisions on this point were brought to my notice by Mr. Fazeel. The first case on this point is the decision of the High Court, Lahore, in Abdul Shakoor v. Upton & Co. A I R 1924 Lah. 1 where it was held that in suits for malicious prosecution, proof of the existence of malice itself is not sufficient but should be accompanied by proof of absence of reasonable and probable cause. The Lahore High Court reiterated this view in Nur Khan v. Jiwandas A IR 1927 Lah. 120 and Gobind Ram v. Kaju Ram AIR 1939 Lah. 504. The same view prevailed with the High Court of Madras in V.T. Srinivasa Thathachariar v. P. Thiruvenkatachariar AIR 1932 Mad. 601. This view also found approval of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Balbhaddar Singh v. Badri Sah A IR 1926 PC 46 and in Raja Braja Sunder Deb and others v. Bamdeb Das and others A IR 1944 PC1 in which last case it was further observed that malice cannot be inferred from the anger of the prosecutor.

As regards reasonable and probable cause, the classic definition is that given by Hawkins, J. in Hicks v. Faulkner (1881) 8 QBD 167 that it is, "an honest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon reasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances, which, assuming them to be true, would reasonably lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man placed in the position of the accuser, to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of the crime imputed." This definition was approved by Lord Atkin in his speech in Herniman v. Smith. But in a later decision of the House of Lords, Glinski v. McIver (1962) A C 726 Lord Devlin defined reasonable and probable cause to mean that there must be a cause (i.e. sufficient grounds) for thinking that the plaintiff was probably guilty of the crime imputed. Diplock, L.J. followed this definition in Dallison v. Caffery (1965) 1 Q B 348. It is not necessary that the prosecutor should have the belief that evidence is sufficient to secure the conviction. The requirement of law would be satisfied if the prosecutor has prima facie evidence pointing out towards the plaintiff's guilt Dawson v. Vasandau (1863) 11 WR 516. In an Australian case Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd. v. Brain (1935) 53 CLR 343 Dixon, J. observed that it is enough that the prosecutor believes that the probability of the accused's guilt is such that upon general grounds of justice a charge against him should be brought. It is not necessary that the prosecutor should enter into an examination of the strength of the evidence for the defence. He is concerned only with the question whether there is a fit case to be tried--See Tempest v. Snowden; Glinski v. Mclver; Dallison v. Caffery. The rule may be summed up, according to Lord Devlin, Glinski v. McIver in this way: "Did the Prosecutor actually believe and did he reasonably believe that he had cause for prosecution?"

67. Unsurprisingly, courts have been duly vigilant in guarding against malicious prosecution by clearly identifying and addressing the unsalutary effects of such a phenomenon. It is appreciated that on account of malicious prosecution, there is invariably the incurrence of stigma, mental anguish, severe dislocation caused to one's way of life, and irreparable damage caused to one's self-worth and sense of dignity to which the law is not and the courts should not be impervious to. In the case of Ghulam Nabi Khan vs. Azad Government of State of Jammu & Kashmir reported in 1984 CLC 325, it was held accordingly that-

"Where a person of good reputation for his honesty, integrity and efficiency suffered malicious criminal prosecution that not only caused him mental and physical torture but also proved a big jolt to his reputation, then such person was justified in feeling aggrieved of injury caused to his good reputation and damages were awarded to him for such defamation."

68. In positioning itself within the legal standards required to establish a case for malicious prosecution, this Court finds itself swayed by the following observations recorded in Balbhaddar Singh and another vs. Badri Shah and another AIR 1926 PC 46 which were followed in Naber Shaha vs. Hamsuddin and ors. 15 DLR (1963) 217; LEX/HEPK/0141/1962, that with great lucidity expounds upon the burden of proof required to be discharged by a victim of such prosecution:

"In actions for malicious prosecution the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to show that the prosecution of which he complains was instituted with malice and without probable cause. In an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff has to prove that he was prosecuted by the defendant, that the proceedings complained of terminated in favour of the plaintiff if from their nature they were capable of so terminating, that the prosecution was instituted against him without any reasonable and probable cause and that it was due to a malicious intention of the defendant, and not with a mere intention of carrying the law into effect. The question is not: "Did the plaintiff commit the offence" or did defendant invent the offence against plaintiff; the two queries exhausting the possibilities of the situation. The question is: Has plaintiff proved that defendant invented and instigated the whole proceedings for prosecution."

69. The significance attached on the global plane on measures of deterrence of malicious prosecution merits its due consideration in weight at this juncture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 (ICCPR) denotes the obligation of State in cases of miscarriage of justice resulting in wrongful conviction. Article 14 (6) of the ICCPR states:

"When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence and when subsequently his conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him."

70. In Babloo Chauhan @ Dabloo vs. State Government of NCT of Delhi reported in 247 (2018) DLT 31, the High Court of Delhi, while dealing with an appeal on the issues of fine and awarding of default sentences without reasoning, and suspension of sentence during pendency of appeal, expressed its concerns about wrongful implication of innocent persons who are acquitted but after long years of incarceration, and the lack of a legislative framework to provide relief to those who are wrongfully prosecuted. The Court, vide its order dated 30.11.2017, called for the Law Commission of India to undertake a comprehensive examination of the issue highlighted in para 11 to 16 of the said order and make its recommendation thereon to the Government of India.

71. Pursuant to the aforesaid order of the High Court of Delhi the Law Commission of India defines wrongful prosecution as the case of miscarriage of justice where procedural misconducts- police or prosecutorial, malicious or negligent- resulted in wrongful prosecution of an innocent person, who was ultimately acquitted, with making an observation or recording a finding to that effect. The underlying sentiment being that such person should not have been subjected to these proceedings in the first place. Furthermore, the said Commission clarified the ambit of 'wrongful prosecution' would include (i) malicious prosecution; and (ii) prosecutions instituted without good faith.

72. The Commission headed by Dr. Justice BS Chauhan, in its report, recommended for the enactment of specific legal provision, along with drafting the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2018 containing the definition of malicious prosecution and detailing the procedure for seeking compensation, for redressal of cases of miscarriage of justice resulting in wrongful prosecution covering both the substantive and procedural aspects; i.e., a statutory and legal framework establishing the mechanism for adjudicating upon the claims of wrongful prosecution, and inter alia, award payment of compensation by the State, if so determined. Furthermore, the Commission recommended setting up a 'Special Court' in each district for adjudicating upon the claims of compensation for wrongful prosecution.

73. The United Kingdom, in conformity with its international obligations under the ICCPR, has already incorporated the provision of Article 14(6) into its domestic legislation, i.e., of ss. 133, 133A, and 133B the Criminal Justice Act, 1988 under Part XI subtitled 'Miscarriage of Justice'. In Berry vs. British Transport Commission reported in [1961] 1 QB 149, Diplock J. observed at page 159 that the action on the case for malicious prosecution could be founded upon any form of legal proceedings, civil or criminal, brought maliciously and without any reasonable or proper cause by the plaintiff against the defendant, but, as the action was in case, damage was an essential ingredient.

74. In the USA, claims against malicious prosecution known as § 1983 claims', fall under Title 42 providing that every person who, under colour of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. Moreover, as per the United States Code Title 28 § 1495, the United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim for damages by any person unjustly convicted of an offense against the United States and imprisoned. Apart from Federal Law, all the States in the US have their own respective laws providing for compensation monetary and/or non-monetary assistance to the victims of wrongful incarceration.

75. In cases of miscarriages of justice resulting in wrongful convictions, the Constitution of Germany [Grundgesetz (GG)], 1949, also referred to as the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, assigns under Article 34 the liability for violation of official duty and provides compensation to the wrongfully convicted. Moreover, the 'Law on Compensation for Law Enforcement Measures' (Strafverfolgungsentschädigungsgesetz) (StrEG) in force since 1971 is equipped with the provisions for providing compensation by the State.

76. On the issue of government machinery and executive and regulatory forces aligning to engineer, albeit through a slipshod process, a persecutory prosecution on questionable and trumped-up charges, this Court has painstakingly perused the revelatory information divulged by and crucial indicators of such a probability various prosecution witnesses upon cross-examination. It is a wonder that the structural weaknesses in the prosecution's case represented by such information were not picked up at any stage in the case proceedings from trial up to the High Court Division to flay the prosecution's case one layer at a time.

77. Such state of affair merits, therefore, parading below some stark revelations coming across on cross-examination of several key prosecution witnesses as cumulatively discredit and demolish the maliciously pursued prosecution on the key charge of criminal breach of trust.

78. Relevant Cross-examinations



PW 1 Harunur Rashid

In the cross-examination of Md. Harunur Rashid (Deputy Director, ACC) by the Counsel of Begum Khaleda Zia, Mr. Rashid stated that the Sonali Bank Ltd Ramna Corporate Branch Account Number 5416 form did not bear Begum Khaleda Zia's signature. He further asserted that there was no mention that the account was opened by her or that it was to be operated by her.

In the cross-examination for Mr. Tarique Rahman, Mr. Rashid opined that although Mr. Rahman had claimed that the impugned US dollars were sent by Kuwait Emir to help constituting the Zia Welfare Trust. Mr. Rashid did not communicate with the Kuwait embassy or the Foreign Ministry in order to ascertain truth of this claim. As per his statements, he in fact assumed that the claim was untrue. Mr. Rashid stated in his cross (for Begum Zia) that Begum Zia did not herself constitute the Trust but made someone else constitute the same. However, he further asserted that there was no mention of any orders or directions on part of Begum Zia in terms of facilitating any inter-bank transactions between Sonali Bank Ltd. Ramna Corporate Branch and Prime Bank Ltd. in relation to the Trust fund.

Mr. Harunur Rashid further maintained in his cross that he never received any complaints from any organization, authority, or individuals regarding any irregularities or anomalous activities at the Trust constituted by dint of the Deed of Trust. Only an unnamed source was mentioned by him incidentally.



PW 2 S.M. Gaffarul Alam, S.I. CID, Dhaka

In his cross-examination, PW2 S.M. Gaffarul Alam, the Sub-Inspector responsible for filing the FIR in this matter, stated that the FIR was not accompanied by a forwarding letter from the ACC. This statement was made while under cross-examination by the Counsel for Begum Khaleda Zia. Further, when cross-examined by Counsel for Tarique Rahman, Mr. Alam conceded that the FIR did not specify a time of occurrence. Instead, the FIR referenced a period of approximately fifteen years, spanning from 28.11.1993 to 28.3.2007. He also stated that the FIR specified no reasons for the considerable delay (or arguably inordinate) in filing the case.

PW 8 Afzal Hossain

He further stated that there, in fact, is a fund named the Prime Minister Orphanage Fund (without substantiating why there were no files). He went on to say that although the files in relation to Prime Minister's Relief Fund and Prime Minister Welfare Fund had Begum Zia's signatures, however, no files in relation to Prime Minister's Orphanage Fund bore her signatures. Moreover, he mentioned that every year between 1991 to 2007, both internal and external audits happened, but no objections were raised in such audits against activities of the Orphanage Fund.

PW 10 Mr. Alfa Sani

In his cross-examination by Counsel for Begum Zia, Mr. Alfa Sani, Administrative Officer, Prime Minister's Office, mentioned that during his employment at the Prime Minister's Office, he never handled any files regarding the said Prime Minister's Orphanage Fund.

Other than the transaction details as seized, Monjur Hossain claimed to have no knowledge about any other transaction made by and through the said Orphanage Fund. During the course of his service, Mr. Hossain said, that no communications regarding the deposit, status, transaction, remittance or audit objection with respect to the said Orphanage Fund were made by the Prime Minister's Office through any office letter or memorandum.

PW 27 Md. Jahangir Alam (Deputy Officer Land, Nandigram, Bogra)

In the cross-examination, Mr. Alam revealed several irregularities in investigation. He stated that in their report, there was no mention of any locals who they asked about the Trust Property.

PW 31 Harunur Rashid (Deputy Director, ACC)

In the cross-examination for the accused Begum Khaleda Zia, Mr. Rashid asserted that he had not sent any letters to the Foreign Ministry or Kuwait Embassy to ascertain if the source of the money was the Kuwait Ameer. He noted that he knew (i.e., assumed) that the said money had not come from Kuwait Ameer. He further revealed that no internal or external auditors in relation to any internal or external audits of the Prime Minister's Office were made a witness in this case. He noted further that per the Investigation Report, as submitted by Mr. Nur Ahmed (PW 32), Trust was registered as a Private Trust and that the members of the Trust were not to be treated as public servants. He also noted that there was no proof of any approval from Begum Zia regarding the opening of the FDRs.

PW 32 Nur Ahmed, Director General, ACC

During the cross-examination, Nur Ahmed admitted that he had not documented the details of his daily inquiries in the prescribed form or register, as stipulated by Schedule 7 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Rules 2007 and required under Rule 7(7) of the same. He further acknowledged that Begum Khaleda Zia's name was not on the list of accused individuals recorded in his report and in the description of the accusations documented therein. In his cross-examination, Mr. Ahmed further stated that his investigation report noted the absence of any available documents or files pertaining to the management of the Orphanage fund by the former Prime Minister's Office, thus precluding him to comment with certainty on Begum Zia's alleged involvement. He further asserted that he received no complaints over misappropriation related to the Zia Memorial Trust. He further affirmed that the Trust is a private entity (i.e., a Private Trust) and that the accused individuals were not public servants. Moreover, he stated that the case diary did not contain the filing date of the complaint or even the complainant's name.

79. These inherent flaws in the prosecution's case and indeed the highly motivated and persecutory nature of the case as revealed through the cross-examinations above took centre stage in Begum Zia's section 342 statement. In the course of providing the statement Begum Zia exposed the weaknesses of the case to their very core and which has proven to be very illuminating at this appellate stage in her case.

80. On 2.2.2017 Begum Zia, during her examination under section 342 of the CrPC categorically stated that she would not provide a statement at that time. She requested time to prepare and indicated she would later give a complete statement. After the examination for the day, Begum Zia asserted that despite officially expressing her lack of confidence in the court, she was compelled to undergo examination under section 342 on that day. She said she would obtain a certified copy of the examination and, after discussion with her lawyer, would make a formal statement.

81. On 19.10.2017, she began her statement under section 342, which continued with short adjournments until 5.12.2017. During this time, she detailed instances of political harassment she had experienced. She emphasized a statement made by the then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at a public meeting, alleging that Begum Zia had misappropriated funds from an orphanage trust. Begum Zia stated that the Prime Minister's comments about an ongoing case in a public sitting constituted interference, potentially influencing the court's processes and judicial independence. Further alluding to potential malicious prosecution, Begum Zia noted that corruption and extortion cases against the incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina were withdrawn and dismissed after the latter assumed power. Conversely, cases against Begum Zia had persisted and were being proceeded with unusual speed, if not alarming alacrity, with new cases also being filed. In her statement, Begum Zia also pointed out discrepancies in the prosecution's statements that were revealed during cross-examination. She concluded by denying all charges, asserting they were false, fabricated, and malicious, brought with aim only to harass her.

82. The question that arises at this juncture is whether in the alleged commission of a criminal breach of trust there was any entrustment of any property upon Begum Khaleda Zia and whether within the meaning of section 405 of the Penal Code she had dishonestly used or disposed of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such a trust was to be discharged. It is to be noted that there arises an assumption of a legal obligation from the very act of entrustment and there is a bar imposed under the law in section 405 in that such essentially fiduciary obligation is nullified when the entrustee acts dishonestly for wrongful gain or in a manner that causes wrongful loss to another.

83. Learned Advocate, Mr. Md. Ruhul Quddus in so constructing section 405 asserts that in the facts there was no entrustment as such of any property and no actual dominion over the same within the meaning of section 405. Nor in the facts is there present any element of a breach of any legal contract, implicit or explicit, given that one would be hard-pressed to locate such an assumption of a contractual obligation by Begum Khaleda Zia in the facts.

84. Evident from the High Court Division records is the fact that learned Advocate Mr. A.J. Mohammad Ali and Mr. Khandaker Mahbub Hossain drew the High Court Division's attention to yet another angle to section 405 as pertains to violation of any legal prescription contained in any law. It was their contention in the facts, and aptly so, that the law applicable here is the Trusts Act, 1882 and it is by reference to the provisions of that piece of legislation that the courts of law are bound to assess the liability, if any, of Begum Khaleda Zia under a section 405 scenario. Evidently, however, the High Court Division completely ignored that line of argument and did not at all engage in discussing at any length this focal and crucial issue raised by Begum Khaleda Zia's lawyers. It is now submitted that should the Trusts Act have been taken up for substantive consideration, the High Court Division would have readily been directed to the provisions of section 94 by the terms of which Begum Khaleda Zia assumed the role of a constructive trustee in the facts between 1991-1993. If at all, in the facts, the question of a liability for breach of trust as envisaged under section 23 of the Act could apply to the post-1993 scenario governed solely by the trust settlement deed to which Begum Khaleda Zia is not privy at all.

85. This Court deduces form the facts that the constructive trustee Begum Khaleda Zia discharged her responsibilities under the Trusts Act fully upon transfer of the funds over which she had dominion as custodian from 1991 onwards thereof and with which she had been entrusted until 1993. But that is where her role ended. In other words, Begum Khaleda Zia had no dominion over the corpus of the fund beyond her capacity as a constructive trustee i.e., 1991-1993 and at no time beyond that period can any actus reus be imputed to her with regard to the handling or dealings in such property in violation of the Trusts Act, 1882 or indeed within the meaning of section 409 of the Penal Code.

86. It has been contended on behalf of Begum Khaleda Zia in Criminal Appeal Nos. 64 and 63 of 2024 that the High Court Division committed an error of law in convicting the Appellant by holding that it was her obligation "to secure due welfare and proper use of fund obtained" as no such requirement exists either under section 5(1) of the PCA, 1947 or section 409 of the Penal Code.

87. It is advantageous to examine section 5(1) of the PCA, 1947 or section 409 of the Penal Code. However, the offence mentioned in section 405 of the Penal Code is punishable under section 409 while the offences mentioned in section 5(1) of the PCA, 1947 is punishable under section 5(2). Section 405 lays down that-

"Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or willfully suffers any other person so to do, commits "criminal breach of trust".

88. Section 5 of the PCA lays down the following-

5(1) A public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct-

(a) if he accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person for himself or for any other person, any gratification (other than legal remuneration) as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in section 161 of the Penal Code, or

(b) if he accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain for himself or for any other person any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate, from any person whom he knows to have been, or to be, or to be likely to be concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by him, or having any connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate, or from any person whom he knows to be interested in or related to the person so concerned, or

(c) if he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates or otherwise converts for his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allows any other person so to do, or

(d) if he, by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position as public servant, obtains or attempts to obtain for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage, or

(e) if he, or any of his dependents, is in possession, for which the public servant cannot reasonably account, of pecuniary resources or of property disproportionate to his known sources of income.

Explanation. In this clause "dependent" in relation to a public servant, means his wife, children and step-children, parents, sisters and minor brothers residing with and wholly dependent on him.

(2) Any public servant who commits or attempts to commit criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both, and the pecuniary resources or property to which the criminal misconduct relates may also be confiscated to the State.

..."

89. From the above provisions of law, it is divulged that neither section 405 of the Penal Code nor section  of the PCA, 1947 contains the words "to secure due welfare and proper use of fund obtained". However, the Golden Rule of interpretation gives the court latitude to modify the literal meaning of a law to avoid an absurd or unreasonable outcome. The said rule of interpretation essentially provides the court a way to deviate from the strict, literal meaning of words when that meaning would lead to an unjust or nonsensical result or an absurdity. Given that, if a person dishonestly misappropriates or uses the property over which he has dominion, he is punishable for the offence. It is, therefore, palpably clear that despite there are no words "to secure due welfare and proper use of fund obtained" couched in section 405 of the Penal Code or section 5(1) of the PCA, 1947 it will suffice to hold a public servant guilty if it is proved that he dishonestly misappropriates or does not make proper use of the property over which he has dominion.

90. In the case in hand, indeed, the crux of the matter is that how far the prosecution proved the allegations under section 405 of the Penal Code or section 5(1) of the PCA, 1947. However, it is evinced from the record that the prosecution utterly failed to prove the allegations against Begum Khaleda Zia as stated above beyond reasonable doubt. In any case of the matter, the probe into the element of "securing due welfare and proper use of fund obtained" is a superfluous one given our findings hereinabove, that there was no outright entrustment of property to Begum Khaleda Zia to begin with. In the facts, accordingly, and from the evidence adduced there is no ground to hold that the High Court Division's deduction as to "secure due welfare and proper use of fund obtained" was in anyway well-founded.

91. It has further been contended on behalf of Begum Khaleda Zia that the enhancement of sentence can only be made in appeal preferred against the judgment passed by the trial court. Section 417A of the CrPC provides for the provisions for preferring appeal against the inadequacy of sentence. Section 439(5) of the CrPC lays down that where an appeal lies under the CrPC and no appeal is brought, no proceedings by way of revision shall be entertained at the instance of the party who could have appealed. However, in the case in hand, no appeal was filed by the ACC against the inadequacy of sentence.

92. From a perusal of the judgment of the trial court it appears that the Special Judge convicted Begum Khaleda Zia under section 409 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the PCA, 1947. It is settled position of law that a person aggrieved against the judgment and order of conviction passed by the Special Judge, is entitled to prefer appeal before the High Court Division under section 10(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. However, there is no categorical provision in the Criminal Law Amendment Act as to whether the State or the ACC can file revision against the inadequacy of sentence passed by the Special Judge. In this regard, we may profitably extract section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958.

"10. (1) An appeal from the judgment of a Special Judge shall lie to-

(a) the High Court Division, if the Special Judge is or has been a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge or an Assistant Sessions Judge:

(1A) The Court to which an appeal lies under sub-section (1) shall also have powers of revisions.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 417 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, in any case tried by a Special Judge appointed by the Government under section 3, in which such Special Judge has passed an order of acquittal, the Commission may direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to such Court as aforesaid.

(Emphasis added by this Court)

93. Thus, an appeal under section 10(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act shall lie before the High Court Division against the judgment of the Special Judge while section 10(1A) invests the High Court Division with the power of revision. However, it has not been categorically provided in the Criminal Law Amendment Act whether either appeal or revision will lie against the inadequacy of sentence passed by the Special Judge. That said, it is the case, moreover, there is no express statutory bar to filing revision in the instance of inadequate sentencing passed by the Special Judge. Given such circumstance, the overwhelming consideration that the Criminal Law Amendment Act being a piece of special legislation governs necessarily sentencing under an equally special piece of legislation like the PCA. It necessarily follows, therefore, that under such circumstances the door is always open under section 10(1A) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act to file revision even in instances of inadequate sentences. Therefore, we must necessarily conclude that in the given circumstances, it may logically be deduced that revision will lie in the High Court Division under section 10(1A) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. The above legal exposition finds support from the decision made by this Division in the case of Durnity Daman Commission vs. Rashedul Huq Chishti and Ors, reported in 18 ADC (2021) 636. This Court observed that-

"From the above discussion, this Division holds the view that a revision under section 10(14) of the Act of 1958 against an order of the Special Judge is quite maintainable and alternatively there opened a new avenue of preferring an appeal under section 22 of the Money Laundering Prevention Act of 2012."

Again, section 5 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 provides that-

"5. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, or in any other law, the offences specified in the Schedule shall be triable exclusively by a Special Judge."

94. It, thus, appears that the non obstante clause incorporated in section 5 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act excludes the application of general law, and as such the special law shall prevail over the provisions of CrPC. Admittedly, the offences punishable under section 409 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of the PCA, 1947 are exclusively triable by the Special Judge. Having regard to the above, we are of the opinion that since there is no provision of preferring appeal against the inadequacy of sentence passed by the Special Judge, the revision will lie against the same before the High Court Division under section 10(1A) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. Such finding as above, though not in consonance with the arguments pleaded by learned Counsel for Begum Khaleda Zia, does not operate in any way to detract from the centrality of our findings above that the High Court Division though rightly invested with the power of revision arrived at a grossly wrong conclusion taking the route of malicious prosecution. It is evident that in the case of Begum Khaleda Zia the High Court while exercising the revisional jurisdiction enhanced her sentence without taking into consideration the evidence on record, and hence the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is liable to be scrapped.

95. Our summary of core findings are, accordingly, enumerated hereinbelow:

I. The convictions under section 409 of the Penal Code, 1860 for alleged criminal breach of trust in the absence of the constitutive ingredients of such offence as defined under section 405 with illustrations are misconceived and have resulted in a travesty of justice.

II. To be an offence of Criminal Breach of Trust, there must be an entrustment/dominion over the property belonging to another and the same has to be dishonestly misappropriated as per section 405 of the Penal Code, 1860 but in the instant case, there was no element of entrustment upon the Appellant Begum Khaleda Zia.

III. The general principle of criminal jurisprudence is that the State has to prove allegation(s) against an accused beyond all reasonable doubts but both the courts below have violated the said principle and convicted the Appellants on an trumped-up charges without seeking the aid of the applicable law.

IV. Both the High Court Division and the Trial Court below passed their respective judgments on the basis of hypothetical presumptions and accusations not based on legal evidences.

V. The ACC has stepped beyond its jurisdiction to have initiated the instant criminal proceeding as the issue revolves around a private trust and there is no accusation/ complaint from the relevant party concerned.

VI. The very initiation of proceedings is barred by law and as such not only the judgments below but also the entire proceedings should, therefore, be set aside giving benefit to all individuals who have been maliciously prosecuted.

In conclusion, in these proceedings we have been alerted to the fact that how much more a court is than a courtroom. It is a process and a spirit structured and nurtured to prevent the violation of constitutional guarantees and the withholding of due process of law. In other words, courts are there to ensure that judicial proceedings are not reduced to being sacrificial rituals.

96. In the premises made above, we pass the following order:

All the appeals are, hereby, allowed by this Division's unanimous decision.

97. Accordingly, the impugned judgment and order dated 30.10.2018 passed by the High Court Division in Criminal Appeal No. 1676 of 2018 with Criminal Appeal Nos. 2215, 2292 of 2018 and Criminal Revision No. 741 of 2018, and the judgment and order dated 8.2.2018 passed by the Special Judge, Special Judge Court No. 5, Dhaka in Special Case No. 17 of 2017 are, hereby, set aside.

98. Consequently, all the Appellants having not been found guilty of the charges leveled against them, stand fully acquitted.

99. The proceedings constituting the subject matter of these appeals are found to be a manifest contrived misapplication of the law as tantamount to malicious prosecution.

100. This judgment shall also extend to other convicted persons who, however, did not prefer any appeal.

101. This decision shall, resultantly restore the Appellants' and all other convicts' dignity, reaffirm their innocence, and thereby, put an end to the unwarranted proceedings initiated against them.

102. All Appellants on bail shall necessarily stand discharged from their respective bail bonds.

103. The office is directed to communicate the order forthwith to the High Court Division as well as the concerned authority for taking necessary action.

    <h3 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">JUDGMENT</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Md. Ashfaqul Islam, J:</strong></p>

    <p>1. This civil appeal by leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 22.08.2016, passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1575 of 2006 making the Rule absolute.</p>

    <p>2. Facts, in short, are that the present appellant along with respondent No.2, as plaintiffs instituted Title Suit No. 199 of 2001 before the 1st Court of Assistant Judge, Dhaka, praying for declaration that the application of Conservancy and Pilotage Service Fees Rules, 1990 over the Costal Ships and Tankers of the plaintiffs established under the Merchants Shipping Ordinance, 1983 is illegal and also for declaration that the letters dated 17.06.2001 and 25.6.2001 and circular vide letter No. M-2/15/47(4) are illegal and unlawful.</p>

    <p>3. The trial Court dismissed the suit. Against which appeal was preferred and the same was allowed by setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court. Challenging the said decision the defendants filed Civil Revision before the High Court Division and obtained Rule. A Single Bench of the High Court Division made the Rule absolute upon setting aside the judgment and decree of the appellate Court and affirming those of the trial Court. Hence, the plaintiff No. 1 preferred civil petition for leave to appeal before this division and obtained leave giving rise to this appeal.</p>

    <p>4. Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant submits that the High Division committed an error of law in passing the impugned judgment and order holding that having not been vested with any right to declare any law void the court of appeal below erred in declaring the imposition of conservancy fees under Section 3 of the "নৌ- সংরক্ষন ও পরিচালন এবং পথ নির্দেশনা ফিস বিধিমালা, ১৯৯০ (hereinafter referred to as Bidhimala, 1990) as illegal.</p>

    <p>5. Next he submits that the conservancy fees are leviable only on "অভ্যন্তরীণ জাহাজ" as defined in Bidhimala, 1990 and payable by the "মালিক" of "অভ্যন্তরীণ জাহাজ" registered under the provision of the said Bidhimala, 1990 and as such the demands made in the impugned notices for payment of conservancy fees from the members of the plaintiffs' samity (Association) whose tankers and coasting ships ply in the river ways which are not "অভ্যন্তরীণ জাহাজ" but are coasting Ships as defined and whose "ownerships" are registered under the provisions of Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983. Without considering the aforesaid provisions of law the High Court Division erred in law in abruptly passing the impugned Judgment and order.</p>

    <p>6. He further submits that the members of the plaintiffs' samity (Association) are the owners of ships/tankers as defined in Section 2(47) and "coasting ship" as defined in section 2(4) of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983 which are not "অভ্যন্তরীণ জাহাজ" as defined in বিধি-২(ক) of Bidhimala, 1990 read with Section-2(e) and (f) of the Inland shipping Ordinance, 1976 and the members of plaintiffs' samity (Association) are the "মালিক"/owner of the said vessels as defined in Section-2(26) and the same are registered under Section 14 and 26 of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983, consequently the High Court Division was wrong in law in not holding that the said tankers and coasting ships of the members of plaintiffs' samity (Association) not being "অভ্যন্তরীণ জাহাজ" as defined in বিধি-২(খ) of Bidhimala, 1990 the conservancy fee is not payable by the members of plaintiffs' samity (Association).</p>

    <p>7. On the other hand Mr. A.M. Amin Uddin, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondent No. 1 made his submissions supporting the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division.</p>

    <p>8. We have heard the learned Advocates of both sides and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division together with the decisions of the courts below.</p>

    <p>9. It is admitted that the ships or the vessels owned by the members of the plaintiffs' Association are mainly ship and vessel in the coastal area but they have to transport petroleum fuel and other goods within the Inland River Way. And the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) is authorized for imposition fees upon the costal and Oil Tanker which are running or transporting within the Inland Water Ways under the provision of Bidhimala, 1990 which was enacted in pursuant to Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority Ordinance, 1958. The relevant provisions of the said Bidhimala are produced verbatim as under:-</p>

    <p>10. Pertinently, let us see the definition of Inland Ship as envisaged in the Inland Shipping Ordinance (Ordinance No.LXXII of 1976). Section 2(e) defines Inland Ship. It enjoins the definition which is worded as under:</p>

    <blockquote>
      "2(e) "inland ship" means every description of vessel ordinarily plying on inland waters and propelled wholly or in part by steam, liquid fuel, electricity or any other mechanical powers and includes a sailing boat, dumb barge and other craft which is not so propelled but is towed or pushed by a vessel so propelled."
    </blockquote>

    <p>11. Combined reading of both the impugned Bidhimala 1990 and the Ordinance 1976 justify the imposition of conservancy fees as aforesaid.</p>

    <p>12. Now, let us further evaluate the entire case on the appraisal of the imposition of the conservancy fees under the Bidhimala 1990.</p>

    <p>13. The learned Advocate for the appellant claims that imposition any conservancy fees by Bidhimala, 1990 shall be double jeopardy for the members of their association because they have to bear taxes for the Coastal Authorities as well as Inland Authorities. But it reveals that the coastal authorities and the Inland River Authorities are different jurisdictions with different types of services, therefore, as per Bidhimala, 1990 any imposition cannot be declared illegal or without lawful authority unless or until Bidhimala is declared illegal.</p>

    <p>14. The appellate court below came to a conclusion that any civil court can entertain any matter where interpretation in respect of law to be declared illegal, even the constitutional provision, within the framework of Order XXVIIA Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure which reads as follows:-</p>

    <blockquote>
      "R.1. In any suit in which it appears to the court that any substantial question as to the interpretation of constitutional law is involved, the court shall not proceed to determine that question until after notice has been given to the Attorney General for Bangladesh if the question of law concerns the Government***"
    </blockquote>

    <p>15. The findings of the appellate Court below banking on Order XXVIIA Rules 1 and 2 as mentioned above leads to absurdity, simply because the said law enjoins that where any substantial question as to the interpretation of constitutional law is involved, the Court shall not proceed to determine that question until after notice has been given to the Attorney General for Bangladesh. To our utter surprise it reveals that the Appellate Court below even did not act accordingly. The findings of the High Court Division on that score is well founded. When the lower appellate Court took notice of Order XXVIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure, it could easily notify the Attorney General of Bangladesh in terms of the said provision of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>

    <p>16. To sum up, first of all, we endorse the view of the High Court Division that the imposition of fees in question is not a double jeopardy. Rather it is absolutely justified.</p>

    <p>17. In the context of adjudicating such a case before this Division where the crucial question of balancing commercial interests and environmental stewardship between parties as well as that of the river is concerned, we grapple with the question of imposing conservancy fees on sea-going oil tankers that traverse inland waters and utilize rivers to access the open sea via estuaries. The ship-owners, in their defense, contend that they fall outside the category of vessels exclusively navigating inland rivers. They further argue that imposing such fees would amount to double jeopardy and inflict undue hardship upon them. However, a closer examination reveals compelling reasons for rationalizing these fees.</p>

    <p>18. In rationalizing the imposition of conservancy fees on sea-going oil tankers navigating inland waters and rivers, despite ship-owners' arguments of exemption and double jeopardy, several points can be asserted. Firstly, the definition of a river includes any watercourse naturally flowing towards a sea, estuary, or lake. Sea-going vessels utilizing these riverways for navigation inherently fall within the purview of vessels using inland waters. Thus, they are subject to relevant fees aimed at maintaining the navigability and health of these watercourses. Secondly, while ship-owners may contend that such fees constitute double jeopardy, it must be underscored that the purpose of conservancy fees is distinct from other maritime charges. These fees specifically contribute to the upkeep and preservation of inland waterways, which are crucial for maritime commerce and environmental sustainability. Therefore, the imposition of conservancy fees is not duplicative but rather serves a distinct regulatory purpose. Moreover, the argument that sea-going vessels are not directly benefiting from inland waterways neglects the interconnectedness of maritime transportation networks. Even if primarily bound for the sea, these vessels rely on riverways for access to ports and estuaries, thereby benefiting from the infrastructure and maintenance funded by conservancy fees. Lastly, acknowledging the significant government expenditure required to maintain river health and navigability underscores the necessity of equitable contributions from all users, including sea-going vessels. In conclusion, the imposition of conservancy fees on sea-going oil tankers navigating inland waters is justifiable both legally and practically, ensuring the sustainable management of vital maritime resources for the benefit of all stakeholders.</p>

    <p>19. It is to be understood by all stakeholders that the conservancy fees are not punitive measures but rather investments in sustainable river management. Ship-owners, as beneficiaries of efficient river navigation, play an essential role in safeguarding these vital waterways. By recognizing the interconnectedness of rivers, estuaries, and the open sea, we can uphold both economic interests and environmental well-being.</p>

    <p>20. The case in hand is indeed of such an impact which as we have discussed above manifestly maintained that the High Court Division was absolutely justified in holding that the Court of appeal below committed an error of law by allowing the appeal and thereby declaring the imposition of conservancy fees by section 3 of the Bidhimala, 1990 illegal and hence cannot be gainsaid that there is a denial of justice in any manner. The judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is elaborate, speaking and well composed. We are not inclined to interfere with the same.</p>

    <p>21. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.</p>

    </div>

    <p><b>Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury, J:</b></p>

    <p><b>1.</b> Pursuant to the Circular dated 28.06.2005, the appellants, having the requisite educational qualifications, applied for taking part in the 27th BCS examination. Upon completion of the primary selection process, they appeared in the preliminary test, held on 18.11.2005, and having qualified in the same, they took part in the written examination, which was held between 18th March, 2006 and 9th April, 2006. On being successful, they were asked to appear in the viva voce examination, which was held between 10th September, 2006 and 20th December, 2006.</p>

    <p><b>2.</b> The appellants successfully passed the viva voce examination, with the final result being published on 21.01.2007. The Bangladesh Public Service Commission (hereinafter referred to as BPSC), vide Memo dated 18.02.2007, recommended 3567 successful candidates, including the appellants, for being appointed in different cadres.</p>

    <p><b>3.</b> In the meantime, some reports were published in different news papers raising certain allegations with regard to the 27th BCS examination, which was, however, refuted by BPSC. Furthermore, in reply to the Ministry of Establishment's letter dated 21.03.2007, the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, by letter dated 27.03.2007, opined that necessary action could only be taken against the persons concerned if specific allegations were investigated and proved under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1956. However, no such inquiry was conducted by the Ministry of Establishment.</p>

    <p><b>4.</b> Subsequently, the Medical Examination of the successful candidates including the appellants commenced on 07.04.2007, but it was abruptly postponed on 18.04.2007 without assigning any reason.</p>

    <p><b>5.</b> In an unprecedented move, the then Caretaker Government decided to cancel the final result of the 27th BCS which had already been published by BPSC. Accordingly, by Memo dated 12.06.2007, the Ministry of Establishment requested BPSC to retake the viva-voce examination of all the successful candidates of the 27th BCS upon cancelling the result of the previous viva voce examination. Challenging the aforesaid decision, Writ Petition No. 6349 of 2007, Writ Petition No. 6384 of 2007 and Writ Petition No. 6393 of 2007 were filed. However, upon hearing the parties, the Rules were discharged by judgment and order dated 03.07.2008.</p>

    <p><b>6.</b> Meanwhile, the second viva voce examination was conducted from 29.07.2007 until 18.05.2008 and the result was published on 23.09.2008, recommending 3239 candidates for being appointed in different cadres under the 27th BCS, excluding, however, 1137 candidates including the appellants, who had previously qualified in the first viva voce examination. Accordingly, a notification was published in the Bangladesh Gazette on 10.11.2008.</p>

    <p><b>7.</b> The present appellants along with several other candidates, who had earlier qualified in the first viva voce examination, filed Writ Petition Nos.8307 of 2008, 8320 of 2008, 9151 of 2008, 4979 of 2009, 8076 of 2009, 8177 of 2009, 7838 of 2009 and 8254 of 2009 challenging the result published by BPSC on 23.09.2008 as well as the office order dated 20.10.2008. Upon hearing the parties, the High Court Division disposed of the Rules by judgments and orders dated 11.11.2009 and 26.01.2010, directing the concerned respondents to appoint the candidates, including the present appellants, who had been successful in the first viva voce examination, in their respective cadres.</p>

    <p><b>8.</b> Challenging the said decision, the Government preferred Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.512, 513 and 514 of 2010. By judgment and order dated 11.07.2010, this Division disposed of the leave petitions upon setting aside the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 11.11.2009. Being aggrieved thereby, the present appellants preferred Civil Review Petition Nos.197-199 of 2024 and leave was granted by this Division by order dated 07.11.2024, which gave rise to the present Civil Appeals.</p>

    <p><b>9.</b> Mr. Zainul Abedin, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in all the appeals, submits that more than three thousand five hundred candidates including the appellants had qualified in the 27th BCS, having been successful in the preliminary, written and viva voce examinations. However, in 2007, pursuant to the directive issued by the then Caretaker Government, BPSC cancelled the result of the first viva voce examination and conducted the second viva voce examination. Resultantly, almost 1,200 candidates, who had earlier qualified in the first viva voce examination, were denied appointment on the ground of being unsuccessful in the second viva voce examination.</p>

    <p><b>10.</b> Mr. Abedin further submits that previously, another set of writ petitions were filed challenging the cancellation of the result of the first viva voce examination, but the Rules issued therein were discharged. He further submits that the judgment and order of the High Court Division passed in the second set of Writ Petitions was set aside by the Appellate Division without granting leave, which was not only violative of the provisions of the Constitution and the Appellate Division Rules, but it was also against all norms of fairness and justice. He submits forcefully that merely on the basis of presumption, the result of the first viva voce examination was cancelled for the purpose of 'restoring public confidence' in view of certain adverse reports that had been published in the newspapers.</p>

    <p><b>11.</b> Mr. Abedin further contends that the instant case is a classic example of miscarriage of justice. Elaborating his submission, he submits that the decision by BPSC to retake the viva voce examination at the dictate of the then Caretaker Government was not only without lawful authority, it was malafide too since neither any law nor any Rules permit the taking of a 'second viva voce examination'. Since every malafide act is a nullity in the eye of law, therefore, according to Mr.Abedin, the instant appeals are liable to succeed and the judgment and order of the High Court Division is required to be affirmed with a direction upon the respondents to appoint all the deprived candidates of the 27th BCS, who had succeeded in the first viva voce examination, in their respective cadres with all attending benefits.</p>

    <p><b>12.</b> On the other hand, Mr. Muhammad Khalequzzaman Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent Nos.1,2, 6 and 7, submits that the Appellate Division had carefully considered all the material facts and legal aspects of the matter in question and disposed of the Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal and therefore, no interference is called for.</p>

    <p><b>13.</b> This entire episode, albeit sad and regrettable, owes its origin to certain press reports published in February, 2007 in several national dailies raising allegations of irregularities in the process of recruitment of the 27th BCS, which was conducted by BPSC between November, 2005 and December, 2006. Although the reports were unsubstantiated, nevertheless, the Ministry of Establishment issued the Memo dated 12.06.2007 communicating the Government's decision to cancel the result of the first viva voce examination and directing BPSC to retake the viva voce examination.</p>

    <p><b>14.</b> Feeling aggrieved by the Government's decision to retake the viva voce examination, several candidates, who had already been selected on being successful in the first viva voce examination, moved this Court by filing two sets of writ-petitions.</p>

    <p><b>15.</b> In the first set of writ petitions, namely Writ Petition Nos. 6349 of 2007, 6384 of 2007 and 6393 of 2007, the Rules were issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the decision to cancel the result of the viva voce examination of the 27th BCS examination and the declaration of a new schedule for retaking the viva voce examination should not be declared to be without lawful authority.</p>

    <p><b>16.</b> In the second set of writ petitions, namely Writ Petition No. 8307 of 2008, Writ Petition No. 8320 of 2008, Writ Petition No. 9151 of 2008 and Writ Petition No. 4979 of 2009, the Rules were issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the result of the viva voce examination, published by BPSC on 23.09.2008 and the office order dated 20.10.2008 should not be declared to be without lawful authority along with a prayer for issuing a direction upon the respondents to consider the petitioners' appointment.</p>

    <p><b>17.</b> At the outset of the discussion, let us refer to the Memo dated 12.06.2007, which reads as follows:</p>

    <p><b>18.</b> While disposing of Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.512, 513 and 514 of 2010, the Appellate Division held:</p>
    <blockquote>"There is no material on record to arrive at a conclusion that the decision was taken as per pressure of the Government."</blockquote>

    <p><b>19.</b> Quite clearly, the aforesaid observation is incorrect, particularly in view of the Memo dated 12.06.2007, quoted hereinabove, wherefrom it is evident that the Public Service Commission had acted in accordance with the directive issued by the Ministry of Establishment, communicating the Government's decision to cancel the result of the viva voce examination of the 27th BCS examination and retake the same.</p>

    <p><b>20.</b> This Division also held that the present writ-respondents had waived and/or relinquished their claim by appearing in the second viva voce examination, which constituted estoppel. As noted earlier, the decision to cancel the result of the viva voce examination was challenged by the present appellants in 2007 by filing Writ Petition Nos. 6349 of 2007, 6384 of 2007 and 6393 of 2007. However, consequent upon all the Rules being discharged, the writ-respondents had no option but to sit for the second viva voce examination under compelling circumstances. Moreover, the writ-respondents, with limited financial means and resources, were facing the mighty Government and, therefore, they had no other option but to sit for the second viva voce examination. Hence, the finding of this Division that relinquishment of their right by the writ-respondents constituted estopple is not tenable.</p>

    <p><b>21.</b> Furthermore, this Division held as under:</p>
    <blockquote>"In the present case the decision was taken for the public interest as there was wide spread allegation that the process of recruitment was tainted by irregularities and corruption."</blockquote>

    <p><b>22.</b> Once again, I am constrained to hold that this observation is not only erroneous, it is misconceived as well, being devoid of any substance. This Division observed that there was "allegations" regarding irregularities and corruption in the process of recruitment. However, no inquiry was conducted by the concerned Authority nor was any report furnished before this Division as to the nature and extent of the irregularities and corruption that is alleged to have been committed. Nevertheless, on the basis of such unsubstantiated press reports, the decision to cancel the first viva voce examination and retake the same was taken, which seriously prejudiced more than one thousand successful candidates.</p>

    <p><b>23.</b> We have taken note of the fact that at the relevant period, a Member of the Public Service Commission had resigned following the allegation of corruption. However, there is no document on record to indicate that the charge of alleged corruption of the concerned Member was linked with the process of recruitment of the 27th BCS examination.</p>

    <p><b>24.</b> As noted earlier, the Government preferred Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.512, 513 and 514 of 2010. By judgment and order dated 11.07.2010, this Division disposed of the leave petitions upon setting aside the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 11.11.2009.</p>

    <p><b>25.</b> At this juncture, we are called upon to address a pertinent issue, namely, the recent practice of the Appellate Division of setting aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division or the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, as the case may be, at the stage of hearing a petition seeking leave to appeal. This leads me to pose a very basic question- what is the purpose of granting leave?</p>

    <p><b>26.</b> Generally understood, leave is granted to consider the appellant(s) case on certain grounds of law and facts, giving an opportunity to the concerned respondent(s), in whose favour the impugned judgment had been passed, to have an opportunity to reply, in writing, to the grounds upon which the appellant(s) case is predicated. This is in accordance with the constitutional mandate of "due process", as enshrined in Article 31 of our Constitution.</p>

    <p><b>27.</b> Hence, the practice of setting aside any judgment and/or order passed by the High Court Division or the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, as the case may be, without granting leave, is not only a gross violation of the principle of natural justice, it also deprives the concerned respondents from placing their case before the apex Court, a fundamental right granted to them under the Constitution. The principle <i>audi alteram partem</i> -no man should be condemned unheard- is now so well entrenched in the judicial system that any deviation therefrom is bound to be interfered with, even at the stage of review.</p>

    <p><b>28.</b> This novel, not to mention undesirable, practice ought to be 'nipped in the bud', that is, if it can still be regarded as being in the 'budding stage', since, regrettably, this practice has been prevalent for some years now, particularly on and from 2015. I am reminded of an old adage- 'Justice hurried, Justice buried'.</p>

    <p><b>29.</b> The foregoing discussion leads me to discuss another recent phenomenon of this Division -the practice of discharging a Rule issued by the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution at the time of hearing a petition challenging an interim order. In my view, this is absolutely "without lawful authority", as this Division has no power or authority to adjudicate and dispose of any application filed under Article 102 of the Constitution. Let me elaborate.</p>

    <p><b>30.</b> Article 102 of the Constitution reads as under:</p>
    <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
        "102.(1) The High Court Division on the application of any person aggrieved, may give such directions or orders to any person or authority, including any person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic, as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of this Constitution.<br>
        (2) The High Court Division may, if satisfied that no other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law-<br>
        (a) on the application of any person aggrieved, make an order-<br>
        (i) directing a person performing any functions in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority, to refrain from doing that which he is not permitted by law to do or to do that which he is required by law to do; or<br>
        (ii) declaring that any act done or proceeding taken by a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority, has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal effect; or<br>
        (b) on the application of any person, make an order-<br>
        (i) directing that a person in custody be brought before it so that it may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner; or<br>
        ii) requiring a person holding or purporting to hold a public office to show under what authority he claims to hold that office.<br>
        (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the forgoing clauses, the High Court Division shall have no power under this article to pass any interim or other order in relation to any law to which article 47 applies.<br>
        (4) Whereon an application made under clause (1) or sub-clause (a) of clause (2), an interim order is prayed for and such interim order is likely to have the effect of-<br>
        (a) prejudicing or interfering with any measure designed to implement any development programme, or any development work; or<br>
        (b) being otherwise harmful to the public interest,<br>
        the High Court Division shall not make an interim order unless the Attorney-General has been given reasonable notice of the application and he (or an advocate authorised by him in that behalf) has been given an opportunity of being heard, and the High Court Division is satisfied that the interim order would not have the effect referred to in sub-clause (a) or sub-clause(b).<br>
        (5) In this article, unless the context otherwise requires, "person" includes a statutory public authority and any court or tribunal, other than a court or tribunal established under a law relating to the defence services of Bangladesh or any disciplined force or a tribunal to which article 117 applies."
    </blockquote>

    <p><b>31.</b> On a careful perusal of the constitutional provision quoted above, it is apparent that the High Court Division has been vested with exclusive jurisdiction to decide an application filed by an 'aggrieved person' under Article 102 of the Constitution. It is equally apparent that this jurisdiction has not been extended or granted to the Appellate Division. Hence, any order passed by this Division discharging any Rule issued by the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution shall be deemed to be void ab initio, being in gross violation of the Constitution. In my considered view, this is judicial anarchy-plain and simple.</p>

    <p><b>32.</b> Of late, it has become an unfortunate episode that in certain cases, Judges tend to lean towards the Government and pass decisions which are ex facie contrary to the Constitution. In my view, in addition to the concept of procedural fairness, time has now come for the Judges to act and discharge their duties in accordance with "judicial fairness", which implies that Judges must not only act according to law, they must also act fairly and diligently towards the litigants in the dispensation of justice.</p>

    <p><b>33.</b> As has been so aptly stated by the Supreme Court of India in the case of <i>Sadhuram Bansal vs Pulin Bihari Sarker and others</i>, reported in AIR (1984) (SC) 1471,</p>
    <blockquote>"We would do well to remember that justice - social, economic and political- is preamble to our Constitution. Administration of justice can no longer be merely protector of legal rights but must whenever possible be dispenser of social justice." (per S.Murtaza Fazal Ali, J)</blockquote>

    <p><b>34.</b> Be that as it may, having regard to the foregoing discussion, by a unanimous decision of this Court, all the appeals are allowed.</p>

    <p><b>35.</b> Consequently, the judgment and order of this Court dated 11.07.2010 passed in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.512, 513 and 514 of 2010 are hereby set aside.</p>

    <p><b>36.</b> Resultantly, the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 11.11.2009 passed in Writ Petition Nos.8307 of 2008, 8320 of 2008, 9151 of 2008, 4979 of 2009 and the judgment and order dated 26.01.2010 passed in Writ Petition Nos. 8076 of 2009, 8177 of 2009, 7838 of 2009 and 8254 of 2009 stand revived and duly affirmed.</p>

    <p><b>37.</b> The application for addition of party stands allowed.</p>

    <p><b>38.</b> The concerned respondents are directed to comply with directive passed by the High Court Division in the judgments and orders dated 11.11.2009 and 26.01.2010 forthwith.</p>

    JUDGMENT
</div>

<p><b>Md. Rezaul Haque, J:</b></p>

<p>1. The delay of 18 days and 23 days in filing Criminal Petition for leave to Appeal Nos. 569 of 2025 and 677 of 2025 respectively is condoned.</p>

<p>2. Criminal Petition for leave to Appeal Nos. 345 of 2025, 569 of 2025 and 677 of 2025 have been directed against the judgment and order dated 27.11.2024 passed by the High Court Division in Criminal Appeal No. 12374 of 2018 heard analogously with Criminal Appeal No. 12401 of 2018 allowing the appeals.</p>

<p>3. These Criminal Petitions for Leave to Appeal have been heard together and disposed of by this common judgment and order since common questions of facts and law are involved.</p>

<p>4. The prosecution case in the aforesaid Criminal Petitions for Leave to Appeal, in brief, is that Begum Khaleda Zia, during her tenure from 2001-2006 as Prime Minister of Bangladesh had formed a trust, namely "Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust" vide a registered trust deed being No. IV-33, dated 26.10.2004. She opened a Savings Account being No. 34076165 with Sonali Bank, Prime Minister's Office on 09.09.2005 in the name of the Said Trust.</p>

<p>5. During the period from 13.01.2005 to 19.01.2005 various sums of money amounting to Tk. 6,18,89,529/- (Taka Six crore Eighteen lac Eighty-Nine thousand Five hundred Twenty-Nine) were withdrawn from different accounts of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the same were deposited in the account of the said trust.</p>

<p>6. No money was spent from the trust account for any charitable purpose, rather Begum Khaleda Zia, the then Prime Minister, in the disguise of the trust had spent money for purchasing 42 Kathas land in Kakrail in the name of "Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust", wherein she paid, in addition to the value of the land, extra Tk. 1,24,93,000/- (Taka One crore Twenty-Four lac Ninety-Three thousand) to vendor Suraiya Khan as to which no satisfactory explanation has been given which established that she (the then Prime Minister) had misappropriated the same dishonestly.</p>

<p>7. Apart from the money deposited from various accounts of Bangladesh Nationalist Party, other funds had been deposited in the account of the said trust amounting to Tk. 1,35,00,000+ 55,50,000 = 1,90,50,000/- (Taka One crore Ninety lac Fifty thousand) did not have a valid source for which it is apparent that Begum Khaleda Zia (who has been shown as serial No. 1 as an accused), in collusion with other accused persons, committed offence under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with section 109 of the Penal Code, 1860.</p>

<p>8. The case was investigated by the informant Harun-or-Rashid, Deputy Director, the Anti-Corruption Commission, who submitted charge sheet against the accused No. 1 & 3 along with two others under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with section 109 of the Penal Code, 1860.</p>

<p>9. Thereafter, the case record was transmitted to the learned Metropolitan Senior Special Judge, Dhaka, who took cognizance against the accused and transferred the case to Special Judge, Court No.3, Dhaka for trial wherein the case was renumbered as Special Case No. 18 of 2017. The learned Special Judge framed charge against the accused persons under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with section 109 of the Penal Code, 1860 and the charge so framed was read over and explained to the accused persons who were present to which they pleaded not guilty of the offence and claimed to be tried. Charge could not be read over and explained to absconding accused Abul Haris Chowdhury.</p>

<p>10. The case was transferred to learned Special Judge, Court No.5, Dhaka for trial as per the order dated 17/05/2017 of the High Court Division passed in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 19967/2017.</p>

<p>11. During trial, prosecution examined as many as 33 (thirty-three) witnesses but the defence examined none. Upon conclusion of the examination of the prosecution witnesses, the accused Nos. 1 & 3 were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in which they submitted written statements describing their innocence.</p>

<p>12. Defence case, as it transpires from the statement submitted by Begum Khaleda Zia (shown as accused No. 1) under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the trend of cross- examination of the prosecution witnesses, is that, Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust is a private trust established in the memory of Begum Khaleda Zia's beloved husband, Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman and Begum Khaleda Zia was the first Managing Trustee of the said trust in her personal capacity, and her role as trustee had nothing to do with her official position as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, or her official position did not have any direct or indirect influence in the affairs of the trust. The money deposited in the trust account represents donations and contributions made by workers, activists and supporters of BNP across the country and all money deposited in the trust fund came from valid sources.</p>

<p>13. The learned Special Judge, after conclusion of the trial, vide judgment and order dated 29.10.2018, convicted Begum Khaleda Zia i.e. the respondent No. 1 in Cr.PLA No. 345 of 2025 under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and sentenced her to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Tk. 10,00,000/- (Taka Ten lac), in default, to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of six months more. The property which was bought in the name of Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable trust was confiscated in favour of the State.</p>

<p>14. The learned Special Judge also convicted the accused No.3 Md. Ziaul Islam (Munna) under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with section 109 of the Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Tk. 10,00,000/- (Taka Ten lac), in default, to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of six months more.</p>

<p>15. The learned Judge also convicted accused No.2-Abul Haris Chowdhury and accused No.4- Monirul Islam Khan under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with section 109 of the Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced each of them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Tk. 10,00,000/- (Taka Ten lac) each, in default, to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of six months more.</p>

<p>16. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order of conviction and sentence of the learned Special Judge, Begum Khaleda Zia filed Criminal Appeal No. 12374 of 2018 and accused No. 3 filed Criminal Appeal No. 12401 of 2018 before the High Court Division. The High Court Division, after hearing, vide judgment and order dated 27.11.2024 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 12374 of 2018 heard analogously with Criminal Appeal No. 12401 of 2018 allowed the appeals setting aside the judgment and order of the learned Special Judge and thereby, acquitted the accused persons, namely, Begum Khaleda Zia, accused No. 3 and others from the charge leveled against them.</p>

<p>17. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the State and the Anti-Corruption Commission (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') being petitioners filed these Criminal Petitions for Leave to Appeal.</p>

<p>18. Mr. Aneek R. Haque, learned Additional Attorney-General along with Mr. Johirul Islam Sumon, learned Deputy Attorney-General and Ms. Fatima Akter, learned Assistant Attorney-General, appearing for the petitioner-State in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 345 of 2025, made submissions stating that the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division suffers from legal infirmity inasmuch as the prosecution was able to prove the prosecution case beyond all reasonable doubt since there is evidence on record for convicting the accused persons. He has further submitted that the High Court Division committed errors of law acquitting the respondent No. 1 inasmuch as the witnesses corroborated with each other in respect of the offence committed by the respondent No. 1 but the respondent No. 1 could not establish her innocence by cross-examining the PWs. He has also submitted that the informant has supported the FIR story in toto, as such, the judgment and order of acquittal has no basis at all, and accordingly, leave may be granted to address the errors of law committed by the high Court Division and thereby, set aside the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the High Court Division on merit.</p>

<p>19. Mr. Ashif Hasan, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the petitioner-Commission in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos. 569 of 2025 and 677 of 2025, has adopted the same argument advanced by Mr. Aneek R. Haque, learned Additional Attorney-General. He has added though the learned judge of the trial Court has rightly passed the judgment and order of conviction, yet the High Court Division failed to appreciate that the prosecution has been able to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt and as such, the impugned Judgment and order passed by High Court Division may kindly be set aside.</p>

<p>20. Per contra, Mr. A.M. Mahbubuddin, learned Senior Advocate along with Mr. Ruhul Quddus, learned Senior Advocate, Mr. Bodruddoza, learned Senior Advocate and Mr. Aminul Islam, learned Advocate, appearing on behalf of the respondents of Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 345 of 2025 have strongly opposed the instant leave petition supporting the judgment and order of acquittal dated 27.11.2024 passed by the High Court Division in Criminal Appeal No. 12374 of 2018 heard analogously with Criminal Appeal No. 12401 of 2018.</p>

<p>21. No one appears on behalf of the respondents in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos. 569 of 2025 and 677 of 2025 to oppose the leave petition.</p>

<p>22. We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocates appearing for the respective parties and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division along with other connected papers on record. Since both the parties are present before the court and they have delivered elaborate submissions, we are going to dispose of the Criminal Petitions for Leave to Appeals summarily on merit without granting any leave.</p>

<p>23. The prosecution case rests primarily upon the allegations that Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. did not make any donation or payment in favour of Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust; the deposit in the account of Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust was in fact made by Mr. Monirul Islam, Private Secretary to the then Mayor of Dhaka City Corporation using the name of Metro Makers and Developers Ltd; said Monirul Islam stated that money was given to him by Mr. Abul Haris Chowdhury, Political Secretary to the then Prime Minister for depositing the same in the account of the said Trust; Tk. 55,50,000 (Taka Fifty-Five lac Fifty thousand) was deposited on different dates in the said trust including Tk. 27,00,000/- (Taka Twenty-Seven lac) which was deposited on 18.01.2005 by Md. Ziaul Islam, Private Secretary to the then Political Secretary to the Prime Minister who deposited the same in the account of the said Trust as per direction of Mr. Abul Haris Chowdhury; Begum Khaleda Zia by using her official position as the Prime Minister collected the aforesaid funds from various unlawful sources and she paid excess Tk. 1,24,93,000/= (Taka One crore Twenty-Four lac Ninety-three thousand) to the vendor Suraiya Khan, aunt of Mr. Tarique Rahman's Wife, regarding which there is no satisfactory explanation by the prosecution which failed to establish that the then Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia had misappropriated the same in the guise of making additional payment to the vendor.</p>

<p>24. Upon perusal of the record, it appears that Tk. 6,18,89,529 (Taka Six crore Eighteen lac Eighty-Nine thousand Five hundred Twenty-Nine) was deposited in the account of the Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust which was received from the party fund of Bangladesh Nationalist Party in respect of which there is no dispute.</p>

<p>25. Defence firmly asserts that Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. donated Tk. 1,35,00,000/- (Taka One crore Thirty-Five lac) to the said Trust by five payment Orders. Accused Md. Ziaul Islam received Tk. 55,50,000/- (Taka Fifty-Five lac Fifty thousand) from the workers, activists and supporters of BNP across the country and thereafter, he deposited the same in the account of the said Trust on behalf of them.</p>

<p>26. It transpires from the oral evidence on record that the authority of Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. denied the payment or donation to or in favour of Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust. If for arguments sake, it is taken for granted that Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. did not donate Tk. 1,35,00,000/- (Taka One crore Thirty-Five lac) in favour of the said Trust, the question of collecting fund from Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. by using the official position of Begum Khaldea Zia, the then Prime Minister, does not arise at all. However, the documentary and oral evidence on record shows that the Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. might have donated the aforesaid fund which has rightly been pointed out by the High Court Division. It transpires from the evidence on record, particularly from the deposition of Pw-21, Md. Zakaria Khan, DGM, Finance and Accounts, Metro Makers and Developers that Kazi Rashiduzzaman, AGM, Metro Makers and Developers Ltd, was the applicant of the alleged five pay orders in favour of the Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust through which Tk. 1,35,00,000/- (Taka One crore Thirty-Five lac) was deposited in the account of the said Trust. Pw-22, Ziauddin Sawlat Gani, Manager, Shahjalal Islami Bank Limited who had issued the said 5(five) payment orders deposed during cross-examination, "বর্ণিত ৫ টি পে-অর্ডারে আমার স্বাক্ষর আছে। ৫টি পে-অর্ডারে স্বাক্ষর করার সময় প্রত্যেকটির সংশ্লিষ্ট অ্যাপ্লিকেশন ফরম দেখে পে-অর্ডারগুলি স্বাক্ষর করেছি। পে-অর্ডার অ্যাপ্লিকেশন ফরম গুলিতে অ্যাপ্লিকেন্ট হিসাবে রশিদুজ্জামানের স্বাক্ষর আছে।"</p>

<p>27. So, it appears from the evidence on record both oral and documentary that Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. is the applicant of the 5 payment orders in question. The High Court Division also, upon appreciating the evidence in the correct perspective, reached the same finding. Pw-32, the Investigating Officer of this case, deposed, "শাহজালাল ইসলামী ব্যাংকের ৫টি পে-অর্ডারের এপ্লিকেশন ফরম-এ টাকার নোটের বর্ণনা দেয়া নাই। বর্ণিত ৫ টি পে-অর্ডার ফরমে ও পে-অর্ডারে শুধুমাত্র মোট টাকার উল্লেখ আছে। বস্তু প্রদর্শনী-III series পে-অর্ডার এপ্লিকেশন ফরম এর প্রতিটিতে ১১৫/- টাকার কমিশন ও ভ্যাট গ্রহণের কথা উল্লেখ আছে। মেট্রো মেকারস্ এন্ড ডেভেলপারস্ লি: এর নামীয় ব্যাংক হিসাব বিবরণী বস্তু প্রদর্শনী- XI(C) এর ৫ম পাতায় ১৬/০১/২০০৫ ইং তারিখের এন্ট্রিতে ৫টি পে-অর্ডারের বিপরীতে ৫৭৫/- টাকা ডেবিট করার কথা উল্লেখ আছে। বস্তু প্রদর্শনী XI(C) ব্যাংক হিসাব বিবরণীতে ১৬.০১.২০০৫ খ্রিঃ তারিখে মেট্রোমেকারস্ এন্ড ডেভেলপারস্ লিঃ এর ৪ টি ক্লিয়ারিং চেকের মাধ্যমে এক কোটি টাকার ঊর্ধ্বে ডেবিটেড করার বিষয় এন্ট্রি করা আছে। ১৬.০১.২০০৫ ইং তারিখের ব্যাংক হিসাব বিবরণীর বস্তু প্রদর্শনী- XI(C) এর এন্ট্রিকৃত ক্লিয়ারিং চেকে ১,২২,০০০/-, ৭৭,০০০/-, ১,৩৯,০০০/-, ১,০০,০০,০০০/- টাকা এন্ট্রি দেয়া আছে। ব্যাংক হিসাব বিবরণী বস্তু প্রদর্শনী- XI(C) তে ১৫/০১/২০০৫ ইং তারিখের এন্ট্রিতে ২ টি ক্লিয়ারিং চেকে ২৫,০০,০০০/- এবং ২৫,০০,০০০/- টাকা এন্ট্রি করা আছে। ১৫.০১.২০০৫ এবং ১৬.০১.২০০৫ ইং তারিখের ক্লিয়ারিং চেকগুলো এসএনডি দ্বারা শুরু হয়েছে তবে চেক নম্বরগুলি ভিন্ন। ক্লিয়ারিং চেকগুলি সম্পর্কে তদন্ত করেছি এবং সংশ্লিষ্ট সাক্ষীকে জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করে জবানবন্দি রেকর্ড করেছি তবে সাক্ষীর জবানবন্দিতে চেকগুলির বিষয়ে কোনো ব্যাখ্যা লেখা নাই।" Pw-32 further deposed, "১৬.০১.২০০৫ তারিখের যে সব ক্লিয়ারিং চেকমূলে ডেবিট করার বিষয় বলেছি সে সব চেক বিষয়ে সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যক্তিদের জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করে তাদের জবানবন্দি রেকর্ড করিনি।"</p>

<p>28. It transpires from the evidence on record that the account statement of the Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. demonstrates that applicable commission and VAT against the issuance of the said five payments orders were charged to the account of the said Company which negates the claim of the said company that it was not the originator of the impugned five payment orders. The High Court Division also rightly pointed out this vital aspect of the evidence which affects the merit of the case substantially. The Investigating Officer deposed at one stage of cross examination that he had investigated about the clearing cheques and recorded the statements of the persons concerned with the clearing cheques after interrogation but in the later stage of the cross-examination he deposed that he had not recorded the statements of the persons concerned with the clearing cheques after investigation which is contradictory to his previous statement, which creates doubt as to whether he had investigated about the clearing cheques at all. It appears that the Investigating Officer did not investigate the case properly.</p>

<p>29. It is well settled that the contents of documentary evidence should ordinarily get preference over oral evidence unless the alleged document is the product of forgery or false personation. The trial court failed to appreciate the documentary evidence juxtaposing the oral evidence of the Investigating Officer for which it reached erroneous conclusion that Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. did not make payment in the account of the said Trust though there was reasonable doubt that Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. might have made payment in the account of the said Trust having regard to the account statement of the said company and oral testimony of the Investigating Officer that he did not record after interrogation the statements of the persons concerned with the clearing cheques dated 16.01.2005. The High Court Division rightly appreciated the documentary evidence in its correct perspective juxtaposing the oral evidence of the prosecution witnesses and thereby, correctly recorded the finding that Metro Makers and the Developers Ltd. might have paid Tk. 1,35,00,000/- (Taka One crore Thirty-Five lac) through 5(five) payment orders in the account of the said Trust. There is no evidence on record that Begum Khaleda Zia, the then Prime Minister, used her Official position to compel Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. to make donation in the account of the Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust.</p>

<p>30. The Investigating Officer, PW-32, deposed during his cross-examination, "বিভিন্ন ব্যাংকে মেট্রো মেকার্স এন্ড ডেভেলপার্স এর নামে ৫ টি হিসাব এবং উক্ত কোম্পানীর এমডি, ডিএমডিদের নামেও পৃথক ব্যাংক একাউন্ট আছে। মেট্রো মেকার্স এন্ড ডেভেলপার্স লিঃ এর নামীয় বা উক্ত কোম্পানীর এমডি, ডিএমডি-এর নামীয় ব্যাংক হিসাব সমূহের চেকবই সমূহের মুড়ি আমি পরীক্ষা করে দেখিনি। ১৬.০১.২০০৫ ইং তারিখের অব্যবহিত পূর্বের ১ মাস এবং অব্যবহিত পরের ১ মাস মেট্রো মেকার্স এন্ড ডেভেলপার্স লিমিটেড কোম্পানি কি পরিমাণ জমি বা কত টাকা মূল্যের জমি কেনা-বেচা করেছিল তা আমি তদন্ত করে দেখিনি। মেট্রো মেকার্স এন্ড ডেভেলপার্স লিঃ এর কোন ল্যান্ড সেলস রেজিস্টার ছিল কিনা তা আমার জানা নাই এবং আমি উক্তরূপ কোন সেলস রেজিস্টার জব্দ করিনি। মেট্রো মেকারস এন্ড ডেভেলপার্স লিঃ এর অফিসে যেয়ে কোন ল্যান্ড সেলস রেজিস্টার দেখতে চাইনি। মেট্রো মেকারস এন্ড ডেভেলপার্স লিমিটেড এর ব্যাংক হিসাবসমূহের কাগজপত্র জব্দ করার জন্য বিজ্ঞ সিনিয়র স্পেশাল জজ আদালত, ঢাকায় কোন সময় আবেদন করিনি। এম.ডি.জনাব এ.এফ.এম জাহাঙ্গীর হোসেন সাহেবের ব্যক্তিগত নামেও বিভিন্ন ব্যাংক হিসাব ছিল যা আমি তদন্তে পেয়েছিলাম। আমি জনাব জাহাঙ্গীর হোসেনের ব্যক্তিগত ব্যাংক হিসাব সমূহের কাগজাদি জব্দ করার জন্য বিজ্ঞ সিনিয়র স্পেশাল জজ আদালতে আবেদন করিনি। মেট্রো মেকার্স এন্ড ডেভেলপার্স লিঃ কোম্পানীর অডিট যে সব ফার্ম করেছে ঐ সব ফার্মের সংশ্লিষ্ট কর্মকর্তাকে জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করিনি।"</p>

<p>31. The High Court Division rightly observed by quoting the aforesaid testimony of the Investigating Officer that the prosecution had failed to prove into or intentionally withheld evidence as to, the source of fund donated by the Metro Makers and Developers Ltd to Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust vide 5(five) payment Orders and the investigation of the Investigating Officer is incomplete and perfunctory.</p>

<p>32. There was no embargo in buying property in the name of Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust as it appears from the testimony of Pw-1, the informant of this case, who deposed, "ট্রাস্টের বর্ণিত উদ্দেশ্য পূরণের জন্য চ্যারিটেবল ট্রাস্টের নামে জমি ক্রয়, দালান কোঠা নির্মাণ বা ক্রয় করা যাবে মর্মেও শর্ত আছে". So, we donot find any illegality in buying immovable property in the name of Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust. Now, it is to be seen whether Tk. 1,24,93,000/- (Taka One crore Twenty-Four lac Ninety-Three thousand) in excess of consideration of the sale deed was given to the Vendor with bona fide intent to compensate the vendor for the value of some ancillary materials connected with the property. The Investigating Officer, Pw- 32, deposed during his cross-examination, "সুরাইয়া খান ফৌজদারী কার্যবিধির ১৬১ ধারার জবানবন্দিতে ১,২৪,৯৩,০০০/- টাকা অতিরিক্ত গ্রহণের ব্যাখ্যা প্রদান করেছিলেন কিন্তু তা তার কাছে গ্রহণযোগ্য হয় নাই কারণ তিনি বেগম খালেদা জিয়ার বড় পুত্র জনাব তারেক রহমানের আপন চাচী শ্বাশুড়ী। সুরাইয়া খান তার কাছে বলেছিলেন যে, স্থাপনার মধ্যে এ/সি/ ডিস/ ফার্ণিচার/ফিটিংস/গাছপালা আছে". Though Suraiya Khan was enlisted as a witness by the Anti-Corruption Commission, yet, she was not produced before the court and therefore, presumption under section 114 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act, 1872 can reasonably be drawn to the effect that if Suraiya Khan was produced before the court, she would not support the prosecution case. The reason assigned by the Investigating Officer that he did not believe the explanation given by Suraiya Khan for taking extra Tk. 1,24,93,000/-(Taka One crore Twenty-Four lac Ninety-Three thousand) since she was aunt of Mr. Tarique Rahman's wife does not appear to be a sound one as relationship only cannot be the sole ground to disbelieve the statement of a witness where there may be other justifiable grounds to believe the same. In some cases there may remain some valuable objects in the property sold for the beneficial enjoyment of the property the value of which may not be included in the consideration of the sale deed which may be paid to the vendor later on upon mutual settlement. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case coupled with the testimony of the Investigating Officer it appears that the trial court failed to appreciate that Suraiya Khan took extra Tk. 1,24,93,000/- (Taka One crore Twenty-Four lac Ninety-Three thousand) for the value of AC/Dish/Furniture/Fittings/Trees situated within the property which was sold to Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust and thereby, reached erroneous finding that Begum Khaleda Zia had misappropriated the same in collusion with Suraiya Khan. It appears from record that the High Court Division rightly appreciated this point and reached the finding that the prosecution had failed to prove that Begum Khaleda Zia had misappropriated Tk. 1,24,93,000/-(Taka One crore Twenty-Four lac Ninety-Three thousand) in the guise of making extra payment to vendor Suraiya Khan or anyone on behalf of Begum Khaleda Zia had owned the said money.</p>

<p>33. Prosecution firmly asserts that Begum Khaleda Zia in collusion with other accused by using her position as the Prime Minister collected fund from different persons and allowed it to be deposited in the account of Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust in the name of donation. It transpires from the Judgment and order of the trial Court that Begum Khaleda Zia was convicted for the offence described in section 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, in short 'the Act, 1947', which states that a public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct if he, by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position as public servant, obtains or attempts to obtain for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage. At this juncture, it is worth describing that the word obtain appearing in section 5(1)(d) of the Act, 1947 was interpreted in catena of cases which is much more pertinent to be discussed here for arriving at a correct decision in the case in hand.</p>

<p>34. In the case of <b>Ram Krishan and Others Vs. The State of Delhi</b>, reported in AIR 1956 SC 476, it was observed,<br>
"The word 'obtains', on which much stress was laid does not eliminate the idea of acceptance of what is given or offered to be given, though it connotes also an element of effort on the part of the receiver."</p>

<p>35. In the case of <b>C.K. Damodaran Nair Vs. Govt. of India</b>, reported in AIR 1997 SC 551, it was held,<br>
"The position will, however, be different so far as an offence under section 5(1)(d) read with section 5(2) of the Act is concerned. For such an offence prosecution has to prove that the accused 'obtained the valuable thing or pecuniary advantage by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position as a public servant and that too without the aid of the statutory presumption under section 4(1) of the Act as it is available only in respect of offences under section 5(1)(a) and (b)and not under section 5(1)(c), (d) or (e) of the Act. 'Obtain' means to secure or gain (something) as the result of request or effort (Shorter Oxford Dictionary). In case of obtainment the initiatives vests in the person who receives and in that context a demand or request from him will be a primary requisite for an offence under section 5(1)(d) of the Act unlike an offence under section 161 I.P.C, which, as noticed above, can be, established by proof of either 'acceptance'---- or 'obtainment'."</p>

<p>36. The aforesaid interpretation of the word obtain incorporated in section 5(1)(d) of the Act, 1947 was also followed in the case of <b>Subash Parbat Sonvane Vs. State of Gujarat</b>, reported in AIR 2003 SC 2169 and in the case of <b>R. Balakrishna Pillai Vs. State of Kerala</b>, reported in 2003 (9SCC) 700.</p>

<p>37. From the judicial pronouncements described hereinbefore, it appears that in order to prove criminal misconduct under section 5(1)(d) of the Act, 1947 the prosecution has to prove primarily the demand or request on the part of the accused for any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage either for himself or for other person and the burden of proof of the same lies on the prosecution as the statutory presumption against the accused incorporated in section 4 of the Act, 1947 does not extend to the offence described in section 5(1)(d) of the Act, 1947.</p>

<p>38. In this case, it appears that not a single prosecution witness deposed that Begum Khaleda Zia had demanded or had attempted to demand directly or indirectly from any institution or person any donation or pecuniary advantage for Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust. There is no evidence on record that she, by using her official position, bought property in the name of the said Trust at a reduced price compelling the vendor to agree to the same. It appears from the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses particularly from the testimonies of Pw-1 (Informant), Pw-18 (General Manager Sonali Bank and seizure list witness) and Pw-23 (ex Sonali Bank Officer and seizure list witness) that Begum Khaleda Zia did not use her official designation in the Trust deed or Account Opening Form, cheques or other papers connected with this case. The prime consideration, in the instant case, should have been to ascertain whether there had been any misuse of official position in collection of donation for Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust by Begum Khaleda Zia, which is not established by the evidence on record.</p>

<p>39. Upon perusal of record, it also transpires that there is no bar in the deed of Trust to receive donation from any person or class of persons and it also does not fix the limit as to what extent donation can be received. The informant of the case, Pw-1, deposed during cross- examination, "এই চ্যারিটেবল ট্রাস্টে কার কাছ থেকে অনুদান গ্রহণ করা যাবে কিংবা কার কাছ থেকে অনুদান গ্রহণ করা যাবে না সে মর্মে কোনো বাধা নিষেধ নাই। কে কত টাকা অনুদান দিবে কিংবা ট্রাস্ট কার কাছ থেকে কত টাকা অনুদান গ্রহণ করবে সেরূপ কোন সীমা রেখা বা বিধি নিষেধ ট্রাস্ট ডিডে নেই। ট্রাস্ট ডিডের শর্ত অনুযায়ী ট্রাস্টের জন্য অনুদান গ্রহণের সীমা নির্ধারণ করা নেই।" So, it is clear from the above statement that any person can make donation to charitable trust (in the name of late President Ziaur Rahman). In some cases people make donations to charitable trust without disclosing their identity.</p>

<p>40. It has already been pointed out in the foregoing discussion that Anti-Corruption Commission failed to prove by evidence adduced either oral or documentary that Begum Khaleda Zia obtained donation or any other pecuniary advantage(s) for Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Charitable Trust by abusing her official position. Consequently, the principal offence as aforesaid being not proved, the allegation that accused Md. Ziaul Islam Munna or other accused abetted Begum Khaleda Zia in committing the principal offence stands not proved in the facts and circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>41. In view of the facts, circumstances and proposition of law discussed hereinabove, we are of the view that the High Court Division allowed the appeal upon proper appreciation of the facts and circumstances of the case in their correct perspective which does not call for any interference by this Division. Accordingly, Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos. 345 of 2025, 569 of 2025 and 677 of 2025 are dismissed summarily.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">JUDGMENT</h3>
    <p class="text-bold">S. M. Emdadul Hoque, J:</p>
    <p>1. This Civil Appeal, by leave granting order dated 15.11.2016 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.162 of 2014 at the instance of the appellant, has been directed against the judgment and order dated 17.09.2013, passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1843 of 2008, making the Rule absolute.</p>
    <p>2. Briefly stated, the facts relevant for disposal of this Appeal are that the plaintiff-respondent No.1, Mossammat Monwara Khanam, filed the Title Suit No.329 of 2003 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Noakhali, seeking a declaration of title and recovery of khas possession by evicting the defendant No. 1-appellant, Rejaul Haq, from the suit land described in the schedule of the plaint, stating, inter alia, that the suit land, measuring 18 decimals under Plot Nos.472 and 473 of Khatian No.175, originally belonged to Sadia Khatun and Entaz Miah. After the death of Entaz Miah, his heirs, namely, Abdul Khalek Miah, Abdul Malek Miah, Ruchia Khatun, Zakia Khatun, and his wife, Asia Khatun, became the owners of his share. Subsequently, Zakia Khatun transferred 1-1/4 decimals of land from Khatian No. 175 of Plot Nos. 472 and 473, along with other lands, to the plaintiff-respondent No.1 vide registered deed No. 4835 dated 15.05.1991. Later, Abdul Malek Miah transferred 2-6/16 decimals of land from the same plot to the plaintiff-respondent No.1 through registered deed No. 6834 dated 09.07.1991. The land was subsequently mutated in the names of the plaintiff-respondent No.1 and her husband in a separate Khatian No.772, and they remained in possession and regularly paid rents to the government. Thereafter, Asia Khatun, Abdul Khalek, and Ruchia Khatun purportedly transferred the suit land to defendant No.1-appellant vide deed No. 385 dated 11.01.1997, leading to a dispute between the parties. Despite assurances from the local residents to settle the matter through compromise, the defendant No.1-appellant attempted to set up a petrol pump on the suit land claimed by the plaintiff-respondent No.1. Since the plaintiff-respondent No.1 resided in Chattogram, she requested the defendant No.2-respondent No.2, through a letter dated 06.08.1997, not to grant any approval for setting up the petrol pump on the disputed land, but no action was taken. On 27.10.1997, the defendant No.1-appellant, with the help of hired thugs and labourers, allegedly removed soil from Plot Nos. 472 and 473, and dumped it onto the land of the plaintiff-respondent No.1. Although the plaintiff-respondent No.1's sister-in-law, Durlovi Begum, tried to resist, she was unable to prevent the dispossession. Hence, the plaintiff-respondent No.1 was compelled to institute the suit.</p>
    <p>3. The defendant No.1-appellant contested the suit by filing a written statement, denying all the material allegations made in the plaint, contending, inter alia, that the defendant No.1-appellant purchased the suit land on 11.01.1997 vide deed No. 385, measuring 5-7/10 decimals in Plot Nos. 472 and 473, and mutated the same through Mutation Case No.36/97-98 dated 21.07.1997, resulting in Mutation Khatian No.683. He erected a wall around the suit land, established a petrol pump by spending a huge amount of money, and has been carrying on business there. It was further stated that the lands of the defendant No.1-appellant and the plaintiff-respondent No.1 are different, and the defendant No.1-appellant did not dispossess the plaintiff-respondent No.1 from the suit land. The plaintiff-respondent No.1 instituted the suit only out of jealousy and was trying to harass the defendant No.1-appellant. Therefore, the defendant No.1-appellant prayed for dismissal of the suit.</p>
    <p>4. During the trial, the plaintiff-respondent No.1 adduced the evidence of 4 (four) witnesses, while the defendant No.1-appellant adduced the evidence of 3 (three) witnesses and both sides submitted their relevant documents, marking them as exhibits.</p>
    <p>5. After conclusion of the trial, the Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Noakhali, upon hearing the parties and considering the evidence on record, partly decreed the suit vide judgment and decree dated 29.09.2005.</p>
    <p>6. Being aggrieved, the defendant No.1-appellant filed the Title Appeal No.235 of 2005 in the Court of the District Judge, Noakhali. Upon transfer, the appeal was heard by the Joint District Judge, 3rd Court, Noakhali, who, vide judgment and decree dated 03.03.2008, allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment and decree dated 29.09.2005, passed by the Trial Court.</p>
    <p>7. Being dissatisfied with the judgment and decree dated 03.03.2008, passed by the Joint District Judge, 3rd Court, Noakhali, the plaintiff-respondent No.1 filed the Civil Revision No.1843 of 2008 in the High Court Division and obtained a Rule. Upon final hearing, the High Court Division, vide judgment and order dated 17.09.2013, made the Rule absolute, set aside the judgment and decree dated 03.03.2008, passed by the Joint District Judge, 3rd Court, Noakhali, upheld the judgment and decree dated 29.09.2005, passed by the Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Noakhali and decreed the suit in part.</p>
    <p>8. Being disgruntled with the judgment and order dated 17.09.2013, passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1843 of 2008; the defendant No.1-appellant filed the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.162 of 2014 in this Division. After hearing the parties, this Division allowed the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal and granted leave on consideration of the submission of the learned Counsel for the leave-petitioner to the effect that since the plaintiff-respondent No.1 and the defendant No.1-appellant were purchasers from different co-sharers by inheritance, the suit for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession was not maintainable without a prayer for partition, and the Appellate Court as the last Court of fact, after properly adverting to the evidence on record, reversed the findings of the Trial Court regarding the plaintiff-respondent No.1's case of possession and dispossession, as such, the Appellate Court below rightly allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment and decree of the Trial Court; however, the High Court Division erred in law by interfering in revision without any finding of misreading or non-consideration of evidence by the Appellate Court. Hence, the Appeal.</p>
    <p>9. Mr. M. Qumrul Haque Siddique, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant No.1-appellant, submits that since the plaintiff-respondent No.1 and defendant No.1-appellant were purchasers from different co-sharers by inheritance, the suit for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession was not maintainable without a prayer for partition. However, the High Court Division erroneously restored the decree passed by the Trial Court.</p>
    <p>10. He further submits that the Appellate Court, being the last Court of fact, after properly adverting to the evidence on record, reversed the findings of the Trial Court regarding the plaintiff-respondent No.1's claim of possession and dispossession, and consequently set aside the decree. Nonetheless, the High Court Division erred in law by interfering in revision without any finding of misreading or non-consideration of evidence by the Appellate Court.</p>
    <p>11. Mr. Nurul Amin, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-respondent No.1, submits that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 purchased the suit land from some of the defendants of the original suit, and that defendant No.1-appellant subsequently took forcible possession. Hence, the suit for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession is maintainable in law; as a result, the Appellate Court below committed an error in law by holding otherwise.</p>
    <p>12. He further submits that the Trial Court as well as the High Court Division, upon proper appraisal of the evidence on record, found that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 had prior possession and was dispossessed by the defendant No.1-appellant from the suit land. However, the Appellate Court below, without assigning any findings or observations in this regard, allowed the appeal and thereby erred in dismissing the suit.</p>
    <p>13. He contends next that the Trial Court, on the basis of documentary and oral evidence as described in its judgment, held that the schedule of the plaintiff-respondent No.1's purchase deed would prevail over that of the defendant No.1-appellant, since the defendant No.1-appellant's purchase related to the same land but was made subsequently. As such, the judgment of the Appellate Court below allowing the appeal without addressing the specific findings of the Trial Court was erroneous.</p>
    <p>14. Mr. Nurul Amin, the learned Senior Advocate, further submits that the learned Appellate Court below was wrong in holding that the suit filed by the plaintiff-respondent No.1 was not maintainable without a partition by the co-sharers, and in failing to appreciate that there had been an amicable partition among the co-sharers. Both the plaintiff-respondent No.1 and defendant No.1-appellant stood on the same footing with regard to the partition, and therefore, the plaintiff-respondent No.1's prior purchase should take precedence.</p>
    <p>15. He finally submits that the plaintiff-respondent No.1, by adducing evidence, proved the defendant No.1-appellant's forcible possession and use of the plaintiff-respondent No.1's land and had even sought to resolve the dispute through local salish/mediation. Since prior possession was proved, the decree passed in favour of the plaintiff-respondent No.1 was justified in law, and therefore, the Appeal is liable to be dismissed.</p>
    <p>16. We have heard the learned Counsel of both sides and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Division together with the decisions of the courts below.</p>
    <p>17. In the instant suit, the core issue for disposal of the Appeal is whether a suit for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession is maintainable without a prayer for partition, where both the plaintiff-respondent No.1 and the defendant No.1-appellant have purchased the land from the co-sharers of the suit land.</p>
    <p>18. In the matter under consideration, the Trial Court, after considering the evidence on record, found title in favour of the plaintiff-respondent No.1 and accordingly, partly decreed the suit. However, the Appellate Court below allowed the appeal, mainly taking the view that, in the case of ejmali property, a suit is not maintainable without a prayer for partition.</p>
    <p>19. The Trial Court, in disposing of the suit, took view that the suit is maintainable and not barred by limitation. The Trial Court further opined that the plaintiff-respondent No.1, by adducing sufficient evidence, proved his title and possession over the suit land and also succeeded in proving the case of dispossession by the defendant No.1-appellant, and accordingly decreed the suit in part. In deciding the case between the parties, the Trial Court observed that:-</p>
    <blockquote>
        "উপরোক্ত আলোচনা পর্যালোচনায় ও বিশ্লেষনের আলোকে আদালতের স্থির সিদ্ধান্ত যে প্রদঃ নং ২(ক) এবং প্রদঃ নং ক এ উল্লেখিত চৌহদ্দি পরস্পর এক অভিন্ন এবং যেহেতু প্রদঃ নং ২ (ক) এর সম্পাদন ও রেজিষ্টির তারিখ ১৫/৫/১৯৯১ ইং সেহেতু উক্ত দলিল সম্পাদন ও রেজিষ্টির প্রায় ছয় বছর কাল পরে একই চৌহদ্দি উল্লেখ প্রদঃ নং ক সম্পাদন ও রেজিঃ করা হয়েছে। উক্ত চৌহদ্দিভুক্ত ভূমিতে বর্তমানে ১নং বিবাদীর দখল থাকবার স্বীকৃত এবং ১নং বিবাদীর স্বীকৃত মতেই তিনি ১১/১/৯৭ ইং তারিখে সম্পাদিত ও রেজিঃ কত প্রদঃনং ক মূলে উক্ত ভূমির দখলে গেছেন এবং উক্ত তারিখের পূর্বে উক্ত ভূমিতে তার কোন দখল ছিল না। অন্য দিকে ১১/১/৯৭ ইং তারিখের পাচ বছরের ও অধিককাল পূর্বে উক্ত চৌহুদ্দিভুক্ত নাঃ ভূমিতে বাদিনী খরিদ মূলে দখল অর্জন করেছিলেন মর্মে ইতো পূর্বে আদালতে দৃষ্ট ও প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয়েছে এবং পি, ডব্লিউ-১ এর পাশাপাশি পি, ডব্লিউ-২ মফিজ উল্লাহ, পি, ডব্লিউ-৩ রওশন আরা বেগম ওরফে দুর্লোভী রেগম পরস্পর কে সমর্থন করে সাক্ষ্য পূর্ন সাক্ষ্য দানের মাধ্যমে বিগত ২৭/১০/৯৭ ইং তারিখে উক্ত ভূমি হতে ১নং বিবাদী কর্তৃক বাদিনীপক্ষকে বেদখল করবার দাবী ও ঘটনাকে আদালতে প্রতিষ্ঠিত ও প্রমানিত করেছেন।<br>

    </blockquote>
    <p>20. It is an admitted fact that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 purchased the land on 15.05.1991 through registered deed No. 4835 (Exhibit-2Ka) and also mutated her name. The Trial Court observed that after six years of the plaintiff-respondent No.1's purchase, the defendant No.1-appellant purchased the land through registered deed No. 385 dated 11.01.1997 (Exhibit-Ka) and took possession thereafter.</p>
    <p>21. The Trial Court further opined that, since it is admitted that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 was in continuous possession of the suit land prior to the possession taken by defendant No.1-appellant, and it is also admitted by the defendant No.1-appellant that he obtained possession of the suit land on 11.01.1997, accordingly, it is clearly evident to the Trial Court that the defendant No.1-appellant had no possession of the suit land before that date. It was also found by the Trial Court that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 was in possession prior to the possession taken by defendant No.1-appellant.</p>
    <p>22. Upon consideration of the evidence on record, both oral and documentary, the Trial Court finally opined that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 had proved her title, possession, and the case of dispossession by adducing sufficient evidence. Whereas it appears that the Appellate Court, without reversing the said findings of the Trial Court, set aside the judgment of the Trial Court. The Appellate Court only considered that, since the plaintiff-respondent No.1 had purchased the land from some of the co-sharers of the suit land and the defendant No.1-appellant had also purchased the suit land from other co-sharers, a simple suit for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession, without a prayer for partition, is not maintainable.</p>
    <p>23. We have gone through the judgments of the Courts below. Admittedly, the plaintiff-respondent No.1 purchased the land through registered deed No.4835 dated 15.05.1991, mutated her name, and has been regularly paying rent to the government and the defendant No.1-appellant purchased the land six years after the said purchase by the plaintiff-respondent No.1 and thereafter took possession of the suit land.</p>
    <p>24. After perusal of the evidence on record, it also appears that in both registered deeds, the boundaries have been specifically mentioned, and the defendant No.1-appellant took possession of the said portion of land 6 (six) years after the date of purchase by the plaintiff-respondent No.1. In the deed of the plaintiff-respondent No.1 the boundary of the suit land has been mentioned as under:-</p>
    <blockquote>
        "স্থানীয় চৌহদ্দি:- উত্তরে: চলাচলের রাস্তা দক্ষিনে: আব্দুল গনি গং পূর্বে বেড়ী পশ্চিমে: মোস্তাফিজের রহমান ও কবরস্থান এই চৌহুদ্দির মধ্যে ময়গুঞ্জায়েদ সহ বিক্রীত বটে"।
    </blockquote>

    <p>25. And in the deed of the defendant No.1-appellant the specific boundary has been mentioned as under:</p>

    <blockquote>
        "চৌহদ্দী হিসাবে পূর্বে: সোনাপুর চর জব্বার সড়ক দক্ষিণে: আব্দুল বারি চেয়ারম্যানের বাড়ীর রাস্তা উত্তরে: দয়ালী বাড়ী। অত্র দাগের বাড়ীর চলাচলের রাস্তা পশ্চিমে: কবরস্থান ও খোকা মিয়া এই চৌহদ্দির মধ্যে ৫০ শ: ভূমি দখল বুঝাইয়া দিলাম"।
    </blockquote>
    <p>26. In view of the above, it appears that the Trial Court, after elaborate discussion and consideration of the evidence on record, took view that the boundaries in both deeds are similar. Admittedly, the plaintiff-respondent No.1 purchased the land and possessed the same by mutating her name. However, six years after the said purchase by the plaintiff-respondent No.1, the defendant No.1-appellant purchased the land and took possession of the said portion. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 failed to prove her case of possession and dispossession.</p>
    <p>27. The Appellate Court below, although, opined that the suit was not maintainable as the suit land was ejmali and had not been partitioned, failed to consider that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 had purchased the land six years prior to the defendant No.1-appellant and had been in possession of it, having mutated her name and paid rent to the government. Thus, in view of the above, it appears that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 has title over the suit land. It also appears from the judgment of the Trial Court, the evidence on record as well as the documents produced by the plaintiff-respondent No.1, that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 was in possession of the suit land and was forcefully dispossessed therefrom, and thus filed the suit for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession, which is quite maintainable in the eye of law.</p>
    <p>28. However, in a suit for recovery of possession, the plaintiff must first prove possession and then dispossession. It appears that, in the instant suit, the plaintiff-respondent No.1 succeeded in proving her title and that she was forcefully dispossessed from the suit land by the defendant No.1-appellant. It is also the finding of the Trial Court that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 successfully proved her title and that the defendant No.1-appellant took possession of the said land six years after the plaintiff-respondent No.1 had purchased it. In such a case, there is no bar to file a suit for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession alone, and a prayer for partition is not required.</p>
    <p>29. However, since the defendant No.1-appellant is a subsequent purchaser, he had no option but to establish his right by filing a suit for partition, whereas the plaintiff-respondent No.1 has no such obligation.</p>
    <p>30. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, and in view of the foregoing discussions, it is our considered view that the High Court Division, upon proper consideration of the evidence on record, rightly set aside the judgment and decree dated 03.03.2008 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 3rd Court, Noakhali, and correctly restored the judgment and decree of the Trial Court.</p>
    <p>31. In light of the above, we find no merit in the appeal. Accordingly, the Civil Appeal No.726 of 2016 is hereby dismissed.</p>

<h3>Judgment</h3>

<p><strong>A.K.M. Asaduzzaman, J:</strong></p>

<p>1. This civil petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated 06.05.2015 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 4050 of 2013 affirming those dated 10.10.2013 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Jashore in Title Appeal No. 02 of 2013 reversing those dated 07.01.2013 passed by the Senior Assistant Judge, Chowgacha, Jashore in Title Suit No. 23 of 2005 dismissing the suit.</p>

<p>2. Facts relevant for disposal of this matter in brief, are that Respondent Nos. 1-9 as plaintiffs instituted Title Suit No. 23 of 2005 before the Court of Assistant Judge, Chowgacha, Jashore against the petitioners praying for a declaration that the letter dated 21.03.2005 passed by the Senior Assistant secretary, Ministry of Rural Development and Co-operative is illegal, created, void ab-intio is liable to be cancelled.</p>

<p>3. Plaint Case in short inter alia is that, letter dated 21.03.2013 for site selection of Pashapol Union Parishad Complex building at Pashapol is illegal, Collusive, ultravires, invalid etc. setting up a plea in the plaint that government at any point of time recognized the old site for Pashapol Union Parishad Office is at Bariali Mouza at Kha Schedule land of the plaint where all the requirements for construction of the Union Parishad Complex building though available has been illegally ignored by the government and the government proposed site of the land of the construction of Pashapol Union Parishad Complex Building site having defective title and want of contiguity and less than the required area and is not having any contiguous market, school and want of communication network with the majority villages peoples support of Pashapol Union Parishad for which plaintiff appellant opposite party Nos. 1-9 in a representative character suit and hence they filed this suit.</p>

<p>4. Defendant Nos. 1/12-16, 2-5/18 and 6-11 filed separate written statements and defendant Nos. 6-11 supported the statements of the defendant Nos. 1/12-16 denying all the material allegations made in the plaint stating inter alia that the suit is barred by limitation, defect of parties. The government has approved to establish the Union Parishad Complex at ga scheduled land. The Union Council earlier took initiative to establish the complex in the year 1976 at first. But the Union Parishad Chairman ignoring the said initiative most arbitrarily established the complex at the very north side of the union in the year 1977. Pashapol Mouza is at the centre of the union and the communication is good. There is a Hut, High School, Health complex, mosque, primary school is situated at this place. Almost 12618 inhabitants out of 17719 inhabitants of the said union live in surrounding villages of Pashapol. Therefore it is suitable place to construct Union Parishad Complex. Hence the suit is liable to be dismissed.</p>

<p>5. Trial Court after considering the evidence and hearing the parties dismissed the suit by its judgment and decree date 07.01.2013.</p>

<p>6. Being aggrieved there against plaintiffs preferred Title Appeal No. 02 of 2013 before the Court of District Judge, Jashore, which was heard on transfer by the Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Jashore, who by the impugned judgment and decree dated 10.10.2013 allowed the appeal and after reversing the judgment of the trial court decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs.</p>

<p>7. Challenging the said judgment and decree defendant-petitioners preferred Civil Revision No. 4050 of 2013 before the Hon'ble High Court Division. By the impugned judgment and decree dated 06.05.2015 Hon'ble High Court Division discharged the rule and affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>

<p>8. Challenging the said judgment and decree of the Hon'ble High Court Division, the instant leave petition was preferred and leave was granted on the following grounds:</p>
<blockquote lang="en" style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-family: sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
    "1. Because the Apex Court of the country has already decided that the selection of site of Union Parishad is the business of the Government and relates to Policy matter connecting the administration and as such the plaintiffs has no locus standi to challenge such policy decision of the government and as such the present suit of the plaintiffs is not at all maintainable. But the honorable High Court Division and the Appellate Court has failed to appreciate the settled principle of law and most illegally decreed the suit and as such the judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division is liable to be interfered with.
    <br/><br/>
    2. Because the subject matter of the suit is shifting of site of Pashapol Union Parishad from mouza Bariali to mouza Pashapol. Plaintiffs filed the instant suit on representative capacity for a declaration that the order dated 21.03.2005 passed by the Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operative is illegal, collusive without authority. From the evidence it appears that the said decision was taken after observing all legal formalities. Instant suit is not maintainable under section 42 of the Specific Relief as the plaintiff has no right to any legal character or to any property. Moreover, the site selection is the business of the Government relating to policy matter and as such the plaintiff had no locus standi to file the suit and as such the judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division is liable to be interfered with."
</blockquote>

<p>9. Mr. Md. Ashraf Ali, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that the Apex Court of the country has already decided that the selection of site of Union Parishad is the business of the government and relates to policy matters concerning the administration, and as such the plaintiffs have no locus standi to challenge such policy decision of the government, hence the present suit of the plaintiff is not at all maintainable. But the High Court Division and the Appellate Court have failed to appreciate the settled principle of law and most erroneously decreed the suit, as such the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division calls for interference by this division. He further submits that the subject matter of the suit is shifting of site of Pashapol Union Parishad from Mouza Bariali to Mouza Pashapol. The plaintiffs filed the instant suit in representative capacity for a declaration that the order dated 21.03.2005 passed by the Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operative is illegal, collusive and without authority. From the evidence it appears that the said decision was taken after observing all legal formalities. The instant suit is not maintainable under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act as the plaintiff has no right to any legal character or to any property. Moreover, the site selection is the business of the government concerning policy matters, and as such the plaintiffs had no locus standi to file the suit, and as such the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division calls for interference by this Division.</p>

<p>10. Mr. B.M. Elias, the learned Advocate appearing for the respondents opposes the submission made by the petitioners and the grounds taken in the petitioners and submits that for selection the site by the government specific guide lines were given by the circular dated 28.12.2005 issued by the Ministry of Local Government Rural Development and Co-operative, Government of Bangladesh vide its memo no. ইপ/অঙন/০৬/২০০৫/১৬৮০ (৫০১). But those guidelines has not at all been followed in issuing the memo is dispute as such the same is illegal as it found by the appellate Court in passing the impugned judgment find no illegality in the impugned judgment and decree passed by the appellate court that the aforesaid findings of the Hon'ble High Court Division are the concernment finding of facts based on the material evidence on record and as such Hon'ble High Court Division discharge the rule on merit and he submits that as per said circular the authority should select the site of the Union Parishad Complex and for such selection there is none but he council or parishad of the Union should take the decision at first.</p>

<p>11. Such decision about selection by the council should be taken in a meeting of the council (parishad) but in the instant case any resolution of the council (parishad) took decision to establish their office in their own land and such fact was also reported by the Upazilla Nirbahi Officer such report is exhibited as exhibit 5 in the trial court. The Deputy Commissioner also made some recommendation (exhibit-6) but without following such decision of the council (parishad) subsequent recommendation by the Upazilla Nirbahi Officer and Deputy Commissioner without any reason of shifting for the office or complex of the Union Parishad from its own land to another land was made that the High Court Division further found that but in the instant case it appears that the guideline provided in that circular or the decision of the Union Parishad has not been followed that the judgment of High court Division is based on the material evidence on record. He further submits that the civil court is always competent to examine the legality and illegality in issuing impugned letter dated 21.03.2005 issued by the Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Local Government Rural development and Co-operative, Government of Bangladesh regarding administrative approval and as such suit was not barred by any law. He further submits that the impugned letter dated 21.03.2005 was illegal collusive ineffective and void so the plaintiffs have got locus standi to challenge the illegality and as such suit was quite maintainable.</p>

<p>12. Admittedly the Union Parishad named Pashapol under P.S.- Chowgacha, District- Jashore composed of 17 villages named Bariali, Howli, Duriali, Maligati, Surewsharkati, Raniali, Kaliakunid, Palua, Borogobindapur, Gopinathpur, Bil Erol, Burulia, Dosh Pakia, pashapol, Raghunathpur, Barsha Ranga and Banbahuda. Plaintiffs are inhabitants of 10 villages out of those 17 villages. Since long before the office of Pashapol Union Parishad is running on 65 decimals of land belonged to said Parishad appertains to Plot Nos. 2426 and 2427, 2466 and 2467 of mouza Bariali. On 05.01.1977 by executing a registered deed of gift Sree Upendra Nath Mondal, Sree Ajit Kumar Mondal and Sree Pagol Chandra Mondal of village- Bariali donated the said land for the office of the said union parishad where in the said union parishad building was established. Deputy Commissioner, Jashore by memo dated 09.12.2004 sent a report with recommendation to construct the Union Parishad Complex in Mouza Pashapol, in the same report, he proposed a different land measuring 51.75 acres in Mouza Pashapol and mentioned that the chairman of the Union Parishad and its 08 members were in favour of constructing the complex in Pashapol but infact such report is false and baseless and challenging the said report and subsequently proceedings and the administrative approval of the Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and co-operative for construction of the said Union parishad complex in aforementioned newly proposed land in Mouza-Pashapol and hence plaintiffs filed the instant suit.</p>

<p>13. Trial Court while deciding the suit although upon considering the circular dated 18.12.2005 regarding selection land as well as referring to decision of the Appellate Division in the case of Md. Abdul Motaleb Sarker and others Vs. Md. Laskar Ali and others reported in 15MLR(AD)2010 page 231 found that:

<blockquote lang="en" style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); font-family: sans-serif; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 15px;">
"The site selection is the business of the Government and relates to policy matter concerning the administration and the petitioner as plaintiff had no locus standi to challenge such a policy decision of the Government."
</blockquote>

<p>14. Upon going through the fact of this case, together with the judgment cited by the trial court, which was not properly been addressed by the Apex Court, We are of the view that the petitioner-plaintiffs had no locus standi to challenge the policy making power of the government in any way. The shifting of site of the Union Parishad is a policy matter of the government as well as administrative decision, Plaintiff individual had no locus standi to challenge the same. The High Court Division as well as the Appellate Court by deciding the matter and considering the same, passed the impugned judgment arbitrarily.</p>

<p>15. In view of the above discussion, We thus find substance in the appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division and Appellate Court are hereby set aside and the judgment of the Senior Assistant Judge is restored and the suit is dismissed, however, without any order as to costs.</p>

<p>16. Communicate the judgment at once.</p>

  <p class="text-center judgment-title"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Farah Mahbub, J:</strong></p>

  <p>1. Since common question of law and similar facts are involved in all those 4 (four) civil appeals, as such, those have been heard together and are being disposed of by this single judgment.</p>

  <p>2. These civil appeals by leave are directed against the judgment and order dated 13.02.2014 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition Nos.766, 803, 1242 and 1478 all of 2012 making the Rule absolute with necessary directions.</p>

  <p>3. Facts, in connection with Civil Appeal No.171 of 2015 arising out of Writ Petition No.766 of 2012, in brief, are that pursuant to long term Settlement Case No.1/92-93 the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong executed a registered deed dated 21.03.1994 in favour of the respondent-writ petitioner for 99 years covering an area of 19.29 acres corresponding to B.S. Dag No.1, Mouja-Majherchar, Police Station-Anwara, District-Chittagong. Accordingly, Mutation Case No.1099/2009-2010 was opened in the name of the writ-petitioner, who, upon paying land development tax, had been enjoying possession thereof without any objection from any quarter whatsoever.</p>

  <p>4. Meanwhile, Land Acquisition Case No. 1/2010-2011 was initiated by the authority concerned to acquire 144.05 acres of land of Rangadia Mouja and 451.31 acres of land situated under Majherchar Mouja including the land of the writ-petitioner with publication of notice under Section 3 of the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982 (in short, the Ordinance, 1982). The writ-petitioner duly raised objection thereto vide letter dated 19.08.2010. In this regard, their categorical assertion is that neither they were heard nor their objection was disposed of.</p>

  <p>5. Further assertion of the writ-petitioner is that when the proposal with concise report dated 02.11.2011 was placed before the Hon'ble Prime Minister of the Republic for final approval, in view of Section 5(1) of the Ordinance, 1982, it was sent back to the Ministry concerned on 14.11.2010 with the following remarks: "এমতাবস্থায়, বর্ণিত সমস্যা/ত্রুটিসমূহ আপনোদনপূর্বক সুস্পষ্ট মতামতসহ পুনরায় সার-সংক্ষেপ প্রেরণের জন্য ভূমি মন্ত্রণালয়কে অনুরোধ করা যেতে পারে।</p>

  <p>6. However, the emphatic claim of the respondent-writ petitioner is that the Ministry of Land never submitted any concise report or fresh summary in compliance of the said direction. Rather, without obtaining approval of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Land, vide the impugned Memo bearing No. ভূঃমঃ/ অধিশাখা-১১/অধিঃ/চট্ট-১২৮/২০১০-২৯৬ dated 23.11.2010, gave final approval on behalf of the appellant-respondent government to acquire 07.60 acres of private land and to transfer 587.60 acres of "khas" land under clause 7 of the Land Acquisition Manual, 1997 for construction of coal based power plant jetty and cold storage yard with direction upon the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong (now, Chattogram) to take necessary steps in due compliance of law.</p>

  <p>7. Being aggrieved thereby led to filing the writ petition before the High Court Division under Article 102 of Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, whereupon a Rule Nisi was issued.</p>

  <p>8. Short facts in relation to Civil Appeal No.172 of 2015 arising out of Writ Petition No. 803 of 2012 are that the appellant-respondent Government, vide registered lease deed No.1817 of 1961, leased out 109.71 acres of land under R.S. Dag Nos.241/3C, 241/2C, 241/4C, 241/9C, 241/7A, 241/6A, 241/5A, 241/10A corresponding to B.S. Khatian No.154, B.S. Dag Nos. 1001-1025, 1086-1096, 1100-1101, 1104-1117, 1120-1121, 1126-1128, 1136-1139, Mouja-Rangadia, Police Station-Kornophully, District-Chittagong and 75 acres of land under R.S. Dag No.1/A corresponding to B.S. Khatian No.3, B.S. Dag No.1, Mouja-Majherchar, Police Station-Kornophully, District-Chittagong, in total 184.71 acres of land in favour of the respondent-writ petitioner for 25 (twenty five) years, with possession thereof. Said lease period was subsequently renewed for another 25 (twenty five) years vide registered Renewal Deed No.1769 dated 29.03.2009.</p>

  <p>9. While the respondent-writ petitioner was enjoying possession of the said properties upon paying due land development tax as was required under the law, notice under Section 3 of the Ordinance, 1982 was issued by the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong in connection with L.A. Case No. 1/2010-2011. The respondent-writ petitioner raised objection thereto on 09.08.2010 and again, on 22.08.2010 respectively; those were duly received by the authority concerned.</p>

  <p>10. It is also the categorical assertion of the respondent-writ petitioner that despite the fact that the appellant-writ respondent No.2 was not empowered to reject the objection of the writ petitioner he, upon rejecting the said objection, sent a report to the Ministry of Land for approval. On receipt thereof, said Ministry prepared a summary for the Hon'ble Prime Minister for approval vide Memo No. ভূঃমঃ/ অধিশাখা-১১/অধিঃ/চট্ট-১২৮/২০১০-২৪০ dated 02.11.2010, but without including the objection being raised by the respondent-writ petitioner. The then Prime Minister of the Republic, not being satisfied with the said concise report, sent it back to the Ministry concerned vide note dated 14.11.2010 with direction to submit a new summary with necessary clarification. But without sending report afresh, the Ministry of Land issued the impugned Memo dated 23.11.2010.</p>

  <p>11. On the contention that the initiation and continuation of the said L.A. proceeding was illegal and hence, it was liable to be declared to have been issued without lawful authority and of no legal effect, the respondent-writ petitioner filed writ petition before the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution. Having found prima-facie substance, a Rule Nisi was issued by the said Division.</p>

  <p>12. Short facts in connection with Civil Appeal No.173 of 2015 arising out of Writ Petition No.1242 of 2012, are that writ-respondent No.1, i.e. Chittagong Port Authority leased out 264 acres of land of B.S. Plot No.101, 1(p), 114(p), Mouja-Majherchar, P.S.-Karnaphuli (Bandar), Upzilla-Anwara, District-Chittagong in favour of the respondent-writ petitioner on execution of a lease agreement dated 04.05.2006 for the purpose of Container Freight Station (CFS), Inland Container Depot (ICD), Supply Based Station (SBS), port based and also, port and shipping related industries. While the writ petitioner was enjoying possession thereof on payment of Tk.47 crores as rent on account of the lease agreement, respective notices were issued upon it by the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong under Section 3 of the Ordinance, 1982 in connection with L.A. Case No.1/2010-2011 for acquisition of the properties including the properties of the writ petitioner.</p>

  <p>13. Challenging the proceedings of the said L.A. Case, the respondent-writ petitioner instituted Other Suit No.130 of 2011 before the Court of First Joint District Judge, Chittagong. During pendency of the said suit, the Ministry of Land issued the impugned Memo dated 23.11.2010 with direction upon the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong to transfer the case property of the writ petitioner in favour of the requiring body, treating the properties as "khas" land. In the given context, allowing the prayer of the respondent-writ petitioner, the concerned Court below dismissed the suit for non-prosecution vide order dated 03.04.2012.</p>

  <p>14. At the same, challenging the impugned memo dated 23.11.2010, issued by the Ministry of Land, the writ petitioner filed Writ Petition No.1242 of 2012 before the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution on the contention that the case property belonged to Chittagong Port Authority and that those were not acquired by the authority concerned in connection with L.A. Case No.1 of 2010-2011. As such, giving direction upon the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong to transfer the case land in favour of the requiring body under Article 7 of the Land Acquisition Manual, 1997 was unlawful.</p>

  <p>15. The writ petitioner also relied upon the Note dated 14.11.2010, claiming to have been signed by the then Hon'ble Prime Minister of the Republic in order to challenge the impugned Memo dated 23.11.2010 issued by the Ministry concerned.</p>

  <p>16. Having found prima-facie substance a Rule Nisi was issued.</p>

  <p>17. Brief facts in connection with Civil Appeal No.174 of 2015 arising out of Writ Petition No.1478 of 2012, are that the respondent-writ petitioner is the owner of 0.66 acre of land in connection with B.S. Plot No.1144, 0.18 acre of B.S. Plot No.1145, 0.47 acre of B.S. Plot No.1146, 0.77 acre of B.S. Plot No.1147, 1.70 acre of B.S. Plot No.1148, 3.12 acres of B.S. Plot Nos.1149, 1152 and 1153, B.S. Khatian No.33, corresponding to R.S. Khatian No.12, R.S. Plot No.56, P.S. Plot No.429, J.L. No. P.S. 5, B.S. 31 of Rangadia Mouja, Union-Boyrag, Upozilla-Anwara, at present-Karnafuly, District-Chittagong.</p>

  <p>18. While the respondent-writ petitioner was enjoying possession thereof on payment of land development tax regularly in due compliance of law, a notice was issued by the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong under Section 3 of the Ordinance, 1982 for acquisition of properties including the properties of the writ petitioner in connection with L.A. Case No.1 of 2010-2011. Pursuant to the said notice, the writ petitioner duly raised objection, which was ultimately rejected by the authority concerned. Accordingly, the Ministry of Land prepared a concise report dated 02.11.2010 for placing the same before the then Hon'ble Prime Minister for her approval. Relying upon the Note dated 14.11.2010 their further claim was that pursuant thereto the then Hon'ble Prime Minister gave direction upon the Ministry concerned to submit concise report afresh, which was not complied with.</p>

  <p>19. At this juncture, challenging the proceeding of L.A. Case No.1 of 2010-2011 the respondent-writ petitioner as plaintiff instituted Other Suit No.130 of 2011 before the Court of First Joint District Judge, Chittagong. Subsequently, the writ-petitioner having come to learn as to issuance of notice under Section 6 of the Ordinance vide Memo dated 31.01.2012 for taking possession of the case land, made a prayer before the concerned court below to dismiss the suit for non-prosecution, which was duly allowed vide order dated 03.04.2012.</p>

  <p>20. In the given facts and circumstances, the respondent-writ petitioner filed Writ Petition No.1478 of 2012 before the High Court Division upon the contention that without execution of any agreement with the requiring body, the L.A. proceeding was without jurisdiction. Their further claim was that the then Hon'ble Prime Minister never approved acquisition of the case land in connection with the said L.A. Case. Hence, the impugned proceeding was liable to be declared unlawful.</p>

  <p>21. Having found prima-facie substance a Rule Nisi was accordingly issued.</p>

  <p>22. All those Rules Nisi, except the Rule in connection with Writ Petition No.1478 of 2012, were contested by the appellant-writ respondent, Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong by filing separate sets of affidavits-in-opposition, stating, inter-alia, that the whole process of L.A. Case No. 1 of 2010-2011 was initiated in due compliance of law upon providing opportunities to the respective respondents-writ petitioners of being heard. Also, upon taking due approval of the Government under Section 5(1) of the Ordinance, 1982, the impugned Memo dated 23.10.2010 was issued with a direction upon the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong to take necessary steps in due compliance of law.</p>

  <p>23. Upon hearing the respective contending parties, the High Court Division, vide judgment and order dated 13.02.2014, disposed of all the 4(four) writ petitions making the Rules absolute upon declaring the impugned Memo dated 23.11.2010 to have been issued without lawful authority and hence, of no legal effect, with the following observations and findings:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Therefore, if a land is vested in the Government, the said land ipso facto does not become the property of a statutory corporation or a local authority, unless the Government transfers the said land to the said statutory corporation such as PDB and PDB has also to acquire such land in compliance of provision of section 3 of the said Order of 1972. Therefore, in our view, since PDB ipso facto shall not become owner of the land when it vests in the Government, and since PDB is though a Governmental authority in nature, but is not Government unto itself, further action on behalf of the Government is required to transfer the land to PDB....... Therefore, PDB shall not become owner of the land unless the same is transferred to PDB by Government under section 15(2) of the said Ordinance and for this reason section 15(1) of the said Ordinance has to be complied with by way of executing a prior agreement between PDB and the Government.
  </blockquote>

  <p>24. Apart from this, another aspect that calls for consideration is that the Ministry of Land submitted a summary dated 02.11.2010 before the Hon'ble Prime Minister of the Republic. But the Hon'ble Prime Minister vide note dated 14.11.2010 directed the Ministry of Republic to submit a new summary afresh.</p>

  <p>25. We do not find anything which shows the Ministry of Land to comply with the direction of the Prime Minister made in note dated 14.11.2010. The contesting respondent stated in respect of the said note dated 14.11.2010 that it is unaware of any omission of the Government in this respect. The Ministry of Land did not file any affidavit-in-opposition. Therefore, the said note dated 14.11.2010 leads us to irresistible conclusion that the Prime Minister never had the opportunity to approve the said acquisition of land in the said L/A case.</p>

  <p>26. It is also pertinent to mention that Memo No. তৃঃমাঃ/শা-৫/১ আঃ (খুঃ)-15/2002/378(64) dated 01.09.2002 issued by the Ministry of Land itself clarifies that if the proposed acquisition exceeds 50 standard bighas, the approval of the Prime Minister shall be required.</p>

  <p>27. Therefore, we are of the view that even if only 7.86 acres of land has been directed to be acquired by the Ministry of Land, but since the land required for the whole project of PDB exceeds 50 standard bighas of land, the approval of the Hon'ble Prime Minister is required and in the cases in hand, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the Prime Minister had never had the opportunity to ponder over such approval as Ministry of Land did never submit a new summary as directed by Hon'ble Prime Minister vide note dated 14.11.2010. The action of Ministry of Land in issuing the said memo dated 23.11.2010 directing the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong to acquire the said 7.86 acres of land and to transfer rest of the land to the requiring body instead of complying with the direction of Hon'ble Prime Minister to submit fresh summary is an outright deviation from direction of Hon'ble Prime Minister which is absolutely unconstitutional being flagrant violation of authority of the Hon'ble Prime Minister under Article 55(2) of the Constitution.</p>

  <p>28. the action of the Ministry of Land in the said impugned Memo dated 23.11.2010 is absolutely malafide and such malafide action goes to the root of the jurisdiction and hence the same is without jurisdiction. Further, the whole L/A proceeding being a nullity, the impugned Memo dated 23.11.2010 issued and all further actions pursuant to the said L/A proceeding is also a nullity"</p>

  <p>29. Being aggrieved, the writ-respondent No.1, the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong, as petitioner, preferred Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal bearing Nos. 1869, 1870, 1871, and 1872 all of 2014 before this Division under Article 103 of the Constitution.</p>

  <p>30. After hearing the parties concerned, leave was granted by this Division in all the civil petitions vide order dated 26.02.2015 on 4 (four) counts. However, the following, being relevant, is quoted below:</p>

  <blockquote>
    II. Because, the High Court Division committed an error in relying upon an alleged letter dated 08.11.2010 showing further clarification which was allegedly sought from the office of the Prime Minister to the Ministry of Land without asking the Government to produce the relevant file; however, had the original file been called for, it would have had appeared that there was no existence of any alleged letter which was produced by the writ petitioner and it was nothing but a concocted one; as such, interference by this Division is called for.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Consequent thereto instant civil appeals arose.</p>

  <p>31. Mr. Md. Assaduzzaman, the learned Attorney General appearing with Mr. Annek R. Hoque, the learned Additional Attorney General for the appellant categorically submits that in order to seek equitable relief under Article 102 of the Constitution, the foremost important principle which an aggrieved person is required to follow is to invoke writ jurisdiction with clean hand. If any question arises on that count, it shall be considered as a disentitling factor to grant relief, as prayed for.</p>

  <p>32. In the instant case, he submits, the cardinal assertions of the respondents-writ petitioners, among others, are that pursuant to Note no.4 dated 14.11.2010, necessary direction was given by the then Hon'ble Prime Minister of the Republic upon the Ministry of Land to furnish a fresh concise report in view of incomplete information as to disposal of objections being raised by the parties concerned, but that writ-respondent no.1 never sent fresh concise report. Ultimately, without taking approval of the then Hon'ble Prime Minister, the appellant-writ respondent no.1, vide the impugned Memo dated 23.11.2010, directed writ-respondent no.2 to take necessary steps in connection with the properties in question in due compliance of law.</p>

  <p>33. Said assertion of the respondents-writ petitioners, he submits, are incorrect, for, Note no.4 containing the signature of the then Hon'ble Prime Minister seeking further clarification from the concerned Ministry, as reproduced and quoted in the writ petitions, are non-existent; hence, those are the product of concoction/forgery.</p>

  <p>34. In this regard, he also goes to argue that had the original file been called for, it would have appeared before the High Court Division that there was no existence of the alleged letter/note dated 08.11.2010 in the respective record. The High Court Division, however, basing on the said non-existent letter, categorically found that the Ministry of Land never sent any report, as required by the then Hon'ble Prime Minister and suppressing the said fact, had issued the impugned memo dated 23.11.2010. Ultimately, the respective Rules were made absolute terming the action of the Ministry concerned mala fide with declaration that the whole process of L.A. Case No.1 of 2010-2011 is without jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>35. In the given facts and circumstances, he submits, the impugned judgment and order 13.02.2014 passed by the High Court Division in all the 4 (four) writ petitions is liable to be knocked down for being based on forged documents.</p>

  <p>36. No one appears on behalf of the respondents-writ petitioners to contest the instant appeals.</p>

  <p>37. The obligations of a litigant while approaching the Court for redressal of his grievances must be with "clean hands". Courts have, over the centuries, frowned upon litigants who, with intent to deceive and mislead the Courts, initiated proceeding without full disclosure of facts and came to the Courts with "unclean hands". Courts have held that such litigants are neither entitled to be heard on merit nor are entitled to any relief, interim or final: Kishore Samrite -Vs-State of U.P. (2013) 2 SCC 398.</p>

  <p>38. In the instant case, the respondents-writ petitioners, while challenging the impugned Memo dated 23.11.2010, issued by the Ministry of Land under Section 5(1) of the Ordinance, 1982, have admittedly based their foundation on the note dated 14.11.2010, as quoted/reproduced in the respective writ petitions, on the contention that the then Hon'ble Prime Minister, vide the said note dated 14.11.2010, directed the Ministry concerned to submit a summary afresh. However, the said Ministry, without complying said direction, i.e. without sending the said summary afresh, had approved the acquisition process with direction upon the concerned Deputy Commissioner to take steps for transferring the properties in question to the requiring body.</p>

  <p>39. It appears from record that the Ministry of Land did not enter appearance in the respective writ petitions to contest the Rules Nisi. The Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong, however, contested the Rules by filing separate sets of affidavit-in-opposition stating, inter-alia, that "the concise report dated 02.11.2010 of the Ministry of Land, as quoted in paragraph-23, is matter of record (paragraph 18 of affidavit-in-opposition dated 15.04.2012). The contents of note of Prime Minister dated 14.11.2010 directing the Ministry of Land by the Prime Minister to submit further concise report, as quoted in paragraph No.24 of the writ petition, are also matter of records. The Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong merely acted as per final orders and instructions of Government based on the impugned Memo No. ভূঃমঃ/ অধিশাখা-১১/ অধিঃ চট্ট-১২৮/২০১০-২৯৬ dated 23.11.2010 issued by the Ministry of Land and the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong is unaware of any act of omission committed by Ministry of Land in issuing the said impugned Memo dated 23.11.2010, the contents of which are matters of record (paragraph No.20 of affidavit-in-opposition dated 15.04.2012 and Annexure-5 of the affidavit-in-opposition dated 15.04.2012)."</p>

  <p>40. Taking cognizance of Note no.4 dated 14.11.2010 and also, of the assertions of the respondents-writ petitioners that the Ministry concerned approved the acquisition process vide Memo dated 23.11.2010 without sending summary afresh in compliance of the direction of the Hon'ble Prime Minister, the High Court Division categorically found the action of the said Ministry to be malafide and hence, without jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>41. During the course of hearing of the instant Civil Appeals, the categorical contention of the appellant-writ respondent has been that in the original file of the concerned Ministry, there is no existence of the alleged letter/note dated 14.11.2010, which was reproduced/quoted in the respective writ petitions and that respondents-writ petitioners have obtained the relief in the High Court Division exercising fraud upon the Court; hence, the impugned judgment and order dated 13.02.2014 passed by the High Court Division is liable to be struck down.</p>

  <p>42. This Division, however, finds substance to the said contention in view of the fact that in para 23 of Writ Petition No.766 of 2012, the respondent-writ petitioner has quoted/reproduced the summary dated 02.11.2010 prepared for the then Hon'ble Prime Minister of the Republic, a confidential document, without disclosing as to how they managed to obtain the same and for using them in a court proceeding without being duly authorised, is a punishable offence under the Official Secret Act, 1923.</p>

  <p>43. It is surprising to note that during the course of hearing of the Rules before the High Court Division, neither the Ministry of Land as writ respondent No.1 entered appearance to contest the Rules to clarify the veracity of the said contents nor the appellant-writ respondent No.2 raised any objection whatsoever to the same. Rather, in their affidavits-in-opposition, they discharged their duties negligently by merely stating that the summary note dated 08.11.2010, as reproduced in para 24 of Writ Petition No.766 of 2012, are matters of record.</p>

  <p>44. In the given facts and circumstances, the said stand of the appellant-writ respondent No.2 is unfortunate, unacceptable and hence, strongly deprecated.</p>

  <p>45. However, fact remains, after granting leave by this Division vide order dated 26.02.2015, in particular on ground No. II, corresponding to Note no.4 dated 14.11.2010, the respondent-writ petitioners, in their concise statements, could not controvert the assertion of the appellant-writ respondent No.1 that there is no existence of the alleged note/letter dated 08.11.2010, which was reproduced by the respondents-writ petitioners.</p>

  <p>46. In the given facts and circumstances, the contents of the summary dated 08.11.2010, as reproduced in the respective writ petitions, showing endorsement of the signature of the then Hon'ble Prime Minister dated 14.11.2010, is found to be fictitious and a non-existent letter.</p>

  <p>47. In Lazarus Estate Ltd. Vs. Beasley, (1956) 1 QB 702 PP. 712 and 713, Lord Denning observed:</p>
  <blockquote>
    "No judgment of a Court, no order of a Minister can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything."
  </blockquote>

  <p>48. In the same judgment, Lord Parker L.J. observed that:</p>
  <blockquote>
    "Fraud vitiates all transactions known to the law of however high a degree of solemnity."
  </blockquote>

  <p>49. The High Court Division, while declaring the entire proceedings of L.A. Case No.1/2010-2011 including the impugned Memo dated 23.11.2010 issued by the Ministry of Land as being unlawful, malafide and without jurisdiction, took cognizance of the said fictitious and non-existent note/concise report dated 08.11.2010. Resultantly, the entire judgment and order dated 13.02.2014 by the High Court Division is vitiated with fraud and the same is, accordingly, struck down.</p>

  <p>50. In the result, all the civil appeals bearing Nos. 171-174 of 2015 are hereby allowed.</p>
